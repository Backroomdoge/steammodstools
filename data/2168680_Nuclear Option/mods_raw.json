Thank you all for your support, praise, and feedback on my liveries, missions, artwork, and [url=https://discord.gg/qqMwyr2qxR] Primeva 2082! [/url]\r\nI'm incredibly proud to be a part of this rapidly growing group of NO fans, and I look forward to what is yet to come!\r\n[i] -offiry [/i]\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b] The Process [/b]\r\nThis livery was initially conceptualized in the Nuclear Option Discord's #livery-creation-and-discussion channel. Inspired by the 10th Anniversary BeamNG livery, which B25Mitch had contributed to during his time there, I decided to attempt to organize something similar: a single SFB-81 Darkreach livery with contributions from as many active community members as I could reasonably get in a short span of time. It was later suggested that the Darkreach act as a time capsule of sorts, to represent what the NO community consisted of in 2024, after just over a year of the game's release to Early Access.\r\n\r\nAfter getting flagged countless times on Discord by bot filters and only around a 50% success rate, I was able to finally get a decent number of decals together, and so the decal application process began.\r\n\r\nThis livery was created in Blender with the UCUPaint addon, set to an 8K (8192x8192) resolution with minimal compression. 4 different layouts were started, with Layout 2 making it to a total of 15 drafts. It was baked at the same resolution with 4 samples and 4x anti-aliasing levels, along with FXAA and non-linear filtering. The final project file size was 7.8GiB, or 8.38GB, with the final image being roughly 36MB.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]Just In Case...[/b]\r\n[i] If you submitted something and would like for it to be edited (color-wise, scale, rotation, etc) or you would like to add or remove your name on the underside of the livery, please DM me on Steam or Discord, and it will be changed.[/i]\r\n\r\n[i] If you submitted something but do not see it on the CDR, or are unsatisfied with its placement, sorry! Application was done in a mostly randomized order, and some content had to be cut due to space or other concerns. [/i]\r\n\r\n[i] If you were expecting an invitation to contribute, but never received one, my apologies! I had initially created a recommendation list of around 150 (which later expanded to twice that number) simply based on the most recent activity in the Workshop and Discord. Anyone was welcome to contribute something, of course, but managing hundreds of direct message conversations was quite difficult for me, and it’s entirely possible that I’ve missed a few people. [/i]\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b] Addendum [/b]\r\n[i] Where it all started. [/i]\r\n[quote=B25Mitch, 11/13/2021] I'm working on a game, it's a futuristic physics based combat flight sim with nukes [/quote]\r\n\r\n[b] If you participated in this project and want to be credited via Steam Contributors, please add me as a friend and I can send you a contributor request! (Note: Steam Contributor requests do not appear correctly on Steam Mobile.)[/b]\r\n\r\n[b] If you’d like to participate in future similar community projects, please [url=https://discord.com/users/868850151228317766] DM me on Discord!

A roughly 2.5-hour mission primarily focused around close air support and strike roles.\r\n\r\nLow air threat, large concentrations of enemy ground units. Destroying scattered stolen PALA factories can potentially cripple their air response. No nuke production, adjust nuke stock as desired, default is 0 for both teams.\r\n\r\n[h1] Tankbusters 2 Is now available. [/h1]\r \n\r\n\r\nThis is my first completed mission, it was supposed to be a relatively short-but-beefy close-air-support type experience, but it turned out to be almost as long as a solo escalation match. There's plenty of roaming dynamic ground targets to hit and an economy that encourages you to be skilled in your playstyle, so if you're not a Compass buff by now then this mission will definitely let you break it in.",

The Primevan Revolutionary Forces (PRF), once thought defeated after the first civil war, are once again gaining power in eastern Primeva. The Primeva Armed Liberation Alliance (PALA), still recovering from the civil war, is struggling to contain the growing insurgency. In an act of desperation, they have asked for BDF aid in order to safeguard their borders and preserve regional stability, Boscali has answered PALA's plea for aid. You must strike the PRF and secure the island’s future.\r\n\r\nYou take the role of a BDF pilot as part of two strike groups sent to secure the region. Your mission is to neutralize the PRF threat, restore order to Primeva, and ensure the security of its metallic hydrogen deposits. Players will participate in strikes against PRF strongholds, disrupting their supply lines, and reclaiming key territories. The intensity of the conflict quickly escalates.\r\n\r\nHowever, not everything may be as it seems...\r\n\r\nPlay Order: Operation Primevan Shield -> Operation Sandrift -> Operation Backslash -> Operation Downfall -> Operation Obscura -> Operation Crossfire -> Operation Endgame\r\n\r\nThe lore so far: https://tr.ee/PrimevanCampaign",

If you're looking for a sick image for your project, you can find his profile here: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198335247107/\r\n\r\nMay his pillows always be the preferred temperature and level of hard/softness, and his income free from taxes.\r\n\r\nThis is another commemorative livery, much like the ones I did for me and my dad's cats, Abbey and Annie.\r\n\r\nMabel was my best friend for 10 years and a massively loved part of our family, always by our sides at every moment, especially when there was food around. In early November of 2024, she passed away peacefully at our house, going out doing what she loved the most (eating). Mabel had a few very serious medical issues that popped up basically overnight, and the fixes were just not financially possible, so the only realistic way to move forward was to have a vet come to the house and take care of things before the issues became exponentially worse. We went that route so she wouldn't suffer in the future, because she didn't deserve to live in pain. She now rests in the backyard, buried with her favorite things under the lilac trees.\r\n\r\nMabel was the best cat we have probably ever had, with a unmatched personality and presence. The least i could do to honor her was make a compass livery with her fur pattern and colors. Hopefully you guys like this one, I'm really happy with how it turned out",

While primarily a ground-based unit, exceptionally skilled and motivated pilots may opt into Carrier Dual Mission School, held locally at Cliffline Joint Air Base. Graduates of this demanding course earn their Carrier/Ground Operations (C/GOps) rating and are granted “Golden” status—a title inspired by the golden eagle and trident emblazoned on their pilot wings.\r\n\r\nThis Air Group Commander livery pays tribute to the legendary Golden aviators, as the AGC of Naval Air Group Ignus hails from GFV-30 and is a Golden-rated pilot. Revered for their adaptability and leadership, the BMDF’s Navy and Marine Golden pilots represent the pinnacle of joint maritime-air capability—flying with the versatility and composure of a force that answers to both sea and sky.\r\n\r\nThis livery is part of the \"Vanilla +\" lineup, featuring a remastered design with accurate maintenance stencils and markings, staying true to the game's base lore.\r\n*Art and logos designed by Kaho-Chan, Pictures by WolfSFSyt\r\n\r\nCurrent Version: 1.0\r\n",

    "description": "Absolute Escalation takes place several months after the events of Total Escalation. Several units of the BDF that were out of the country when PALA won the Boscali war have returned. The BDF needs to make landfall and work to gather resources to liberate their territory and ultimately defeat PALA once and for all.\r\n\r\nThe initial stage of the mission is more scripted. It involves two amphibious landing operations; which will require you to assist friendly ground forces. Then, you will make your way north, capturing factories and working you way around to the city. Once you liberate the city, many additional objectives will be made available. These objectives include destroying PALA's resource gathering infrastructure, oil rigs, and a reinforced underground base. PALA has a significant production and strategic advantage.\r\n\r\nThis mission is designed for **high difficulty**, it will be extremely difficult when played solo. Success relies on effective teamwork; players must coordinate with allies to identify and exploit PALA's vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nAbsolute Escalation will take approximately 2-3 hours to complete.\r\n\r\nFeatured Livery: Tobi Five's BDF - IFRIT - NAVY 84 - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3275760807&searchtext=navy",

Born from a tradition of tactical reconnaissance and first-wave suppression of enemy defenses, the squadron is built for precision and persistence in high-risk airspace. However, the 117th is more than just a specialized strike unit, as it also serves as a multirole fighter squadron responsible for day-to-day rapid reaction alerts, frontline support of allied assets, and homeland air patrols.  This dual-role capability makes it one of the most dependable squadrons in the BADF arsenal. Whether hunting radar signatures or flying top cover in hostile skies, the Snowy Owls remain the spearpoint of Boscali’s aerial defense network.\r\n\r\nThis livery is part of the \"Vanilla +\" lineup, featuring a remastered design with accurate maintenance stencils and markings, staying true to the game's base lore.\r\n*Camouflage by Kaho-Chan, Pictures by WolfSFSyt and Aviator\r\n\r\nCurrent Version: 1.1\r\n1.1: Fixed tailcode \r\n",

    "description": "Operation Endgame - the Conclusion of The Primevan Campaign\r\n\r\nThis mission is similar to my Escalation series in spirit - Expect it to take several hours to complete alone.\r\n\r\nOperation Endgame is the final chapter of the Primevan Campaign. As an ARC pilot, you will take part in the largest battle of the war. With its carrier strike group positioned in the northeastern waters, ARC is launching a full-scale invasion to crush the BDF and occupy the Boscali Archipelago once and for all.\r\n\r\nThe islands are blockaded and cut off from outside support. After the \"BDF\" detonated a nuclear device on Agrapol, public opinion across ARC member states shifted, giving leadership the green light for total war. Now, ARC fleets and ground forces are mobilised for a decisive final assault.\r\n\r\nThe BDF, battered but determined, has fortified the islands and will fight to the last man. Meanwhile, the PRF, on the verge of collapse after the events of Operation Crossfire, is providing limited support to ARC forces.\r\n\r\nYour mission: secure air superiority, support ARC ground forces, and strike the final blow to the BDF’s command. Victory here will decide the fate of the archipelago as well as affect things far beyond the islands' borders.\r\n\r\nPlay Order: Operation Primevan Shield → Operation Sandrift → Operation Backslash → Operation Downfall → Operation Obscura → Operation Crossfire → Operation Endgame\r\n\r\nThe lore so far: https://tr.ee/PrimevanCampaign",

Established in 2034 as a branch especially designed to deal with \"Hygiene Threats\", objectives that would be outside of the perview of the National Guard, such as the Zombie Plague, or especially intense insurgencies. The Hygiene Corps are often known for their boots-on-the-ground soldiers, who don especially advanced sets of power armor, as well as many other advanced forms of weapons of war.\r\n\r\nThe Hygiene Corps are especially well known for their use of incendiary weaponry, the most common visual that's been associated with the Hygiene Corps are their routine burnings of Zombie Plague infested locations.\r\n\r\nThe 165th Combat Aviation Brigade, nicknamed the Firebrands, are a Brigade in the 2nd Hygiene Division, known for their specialty use of ground attack aircraft. Their motto is \"You will not be forgotten\"\r\n\r\nI should make lore for the Firebrands specifically one day lol \r\nI also should've included the \"Firebrands\" in the in-game name because I forgot to but I dont think I can change that without re-exporting the livery entirely,,,",

    "description": "The 877th Fighter Aviation Regiment “Dunehawks” are a frontline combat unit of the Primevian Armed Liberation Alliance Air Force (PALAAF), based out of the sun-kissed Sandrift Airbase near the eastern coast. Operating KR-67 Ifrit, the Dunehawks play a key role in securing Primeva’s southern airspace and projecting deterrence across the Boscali frontier. Recognizable by the bold red band painted across their aircraft tails, the Dunehawks have become a symbol of vigilance and resolve within the PALAAF. Their presence marks a long-standing rivalry with Boscali air forces, especially as tensions continue to rise over contested air corridors and strategic islands. The regiment is steeped in a culture of aggressive readiness and national pride, embodying Primeva’s belief in strength through air dominance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis livery is part of the \"Vanilla +\" lineup, featuring a remastered design with accurate maintenance stencils and markings, staying true to the game's base lore.\r\n\r\nCurrent Version: 2.0\r\nChangelog:\r\n2.0: Added red intake linings, retextured camouflage, radar housings. \r\n",

The sailor was tied to a line looped beneath the vessel, thrown overboard on one side of the ship, and dragged under the ship's keel, either from one side of the ship to the other, or the length of the ship (from bow to stern).\r\n\r\nI wanted to create something with a realistic, lore accurate feel. Vanilla+ seems to fit the need for description quite nicely! I created this for my Squadron to use, in multiplayer. I wanted to share it with the rest of the community as well.\r\n\r\n\"Keelhaulers\" is a REAL GROUP and we have a discord server. Check us out and join us if you think you can fly decently.

Formed in the shadow of rising PALA tensions, the squadron earned its name not just for its venomous precision, but for the way it waits—silent, hidden, and patient. Flying KR-67 Ifrits, the Death Adders operate on a doctrine of brutal efficiency: hit fast, disappear faster. Their pilots are known across the BADF as ghostlike professionals—aloof in peacetime, merciless in combat—honed by salt air, jungle sorties, and live-fire drills in the crater-shadowed skies of the Ignus chain. For the enemies of Boscali, the first sign of the 88th’s presence is often the last.\r\n*camouflage pattern by Kaho-Chan\r\n\r\nThis livery is part of the \"Vanilla +\" lineup, featuring a remastered design with accurate maintenance stencils and markings, staying true to the game's base lore.\r\n\r\nCurrent Version: 1.0\r\n\r\n",

With Primeva secured the ARC is facing mounting pressure from its citizens to end the costly occupation, the ARC’s Commanders have been forced to withdraw some of their heavy military assets from the archipelago.

Following a series of defeats, the PALA has seized most of the country and now turns its focus to Agrapol, the Republic’s capital and final stronghold. Determined to end the war and overthrow the Republic’s government, PALA launches a massive assault. Outnumbered, undersupplied, and isolated, the Primevan Armed Forces (PAF) mount a desperate defence, buying time for government leaders and civilians to escape before the city falls.\r\n\r\nAs a PAF pilot stationed in the besieged city, your mission is to provide close air support to the capital’s defending ground forces, protecting the city’s perimeter. You must do everything you can to delay advancing PALA units and cover the evacuation from the city.\r\n\r\nThe lore so far: https://tr.ee/PrimevanCampaign",

    "description": "Carrier Fighter Squadron 19 (CFV-19) “Starstreak” is one of the oldest squadrons in the Boscali Maritime Defense Force, with its origins in naval dive bombing at the turn of the 20th century. Now operating the FS-20 Vortex from the BNS Annex — a controversial decision by the BMDF intended to free up Marine aviation resources — Starstreak is tasked with defending the carrier group from aerial and maritime threats. Despite the shift toward stealth and precision warfare, the squadron still prides itself on conducting steep dive attacks from 40,000 feet, using the Vortex’s unmatched stealth to close with hostile surface combatants. This tactic traces its roots to a desperate engagement aboard the squadron’s former ship, the BNS Aurora Skies, when its guided munitions magazine was exhausted and only unguided GPO‑500 bombs remained. Though the Aurora Skies was ultimately lost, Starstreak aircraft sank two PALAN destroyers and one corvette in the engagement, buying critical time for the ship’s evacuation.\r\n\r\nThis livery is part of the \"Vanilla +\" lineup, featuring a remastered design with accurate maintenance stencils and markings, staying true to the game's base lore.\r\n*Camouflage by Kaho-Chan, Pictures by WolfSFSyt\r\n\r\nCurrent Version: 1.1\r\n\r\n1.0.5: Changed thumbnail to reflect redesigned squadron logo \r\n1.1: Added registration and type designation marking as standard on BMDF aircraft. \r\n",

For decades, the 105th served as one of the BADF’s premier air combat training units. Following a series of budget reductions and force structure changes, the squadron was reallocated to the Air National Guard and redesignated as the 105th Fighter Interceptor Squadron. Based at Ashwood Auxiliary Airbase, a joint BADF-BMDF training and education installation, the 105th FIS maintains round-the-clock alert status, conducting rapid-response interceptions against hostile or unauthorized PALA activity over northern Boscali. Despite the change in component and the expansion of its homeland defense responsibilities, the squadron preserves its aggressor heritage: its pilots continue to serve as high-end sparring partners for the active-duty force, providing threat emulation, advanced training support, and tactical development in order to better prepare joint forces for victory against the PALA. \r\n\r\nThis livery is part of the \"Vanilla +\" lineup, featuring a remastered design with accurate maintenance stencils and markings, staying true to the game's base lore.\r\n*Camouflage by Kaho-Chan, Pictures by WolfSFSyt\r\n\r\nCurrent Version: 1.0\r\n",

    "description": "The 185th Naval Strike Fighter Regiment, known as the “Stormbirds,” is an elite frontline aviation unit of the Primeva Armed Liberation Navy (PALAN), stationed aboard the Harmony Sands artificial island complex. Flying the KR-67, the regiment is tasked with anti-ship strike and naval air supremacy operations deep into contested maritime zones. As the first unit to bear the “Strike Fighter” designation, the 185th traces its legacy to Primeva’s war for independence, where it began as an experimental special tactics regiment conducting asymmetric raids against superior naval forces.\r\n\r\nThis livery is part of the \"Vanilla +\" lineup, featuring a remastered design with accurate maintenance stencils and markings, staying true to the game's base lore.\r\n\r\nCurrent Version: 1.1\r\n1.1: Added a bit of gloss \r\n",

    "description": "The 731st Fighter Aviation Regiment, known as the \"Badgers of Broken Atoll,\" is a hardened expeditionary air wing permanently forward-deployed to Primeva’s most isolated southern outpost. Formed as a rapid-response force during the escalation of Ignus territorial disputes, the 731st was built to thrive in isolation—facing long supply lines, frequent storms, and constant Boscali probing. From hardened hangars nestled between coral ridges, the Badgers launch maritime patrols, fast strike missions, and no-warning intercepts across contested waters. During the Gray Wake Incident, the 731st was credited with the sinking of the BNS Aurora Skies, a Boscali Amphibious Assault Ship, earning them their ferocious namesake. \r\n\r\nThis livery is part of the \"Vanilla +\" lineup, featuring a remastered design with accurate maintenance stencils and markings, staying true to the game's base lore.\r\n\r\nCurrent Version: 1.1\r\n1.1: Changed nomenclature to “Broken Atoll,” not “Atol” lol\r\n",

She’s been in QA for a week!” \r\n\r\nThe 72nd Reserve Fighter Aviation Regiment, known as the “Dusthorns,” is a lean, last-resort unit stationed on the dusty outskirts of Agrapol, Primeva’s capital. Manned by a plucky corps of young reservists, the regiment flies worn, maintenance-heavy KR-67 Ifrits passed down from regular squadrons. With funding scraped from the bottom of the PALAAF’s budget, the Dusthorns keep their fleet flying through sheer persistence and improvisation. Though never expected to lead the fight, they stand ready to defend the capital when all else fails.\r\n\r\nThis livery is part of the \"Vanilla +\" lineup, featuring a remastered design with accurate maintenance stencils and markings, staying true to the game's base lore.\r\n\r\nCurrent Version: 1.1\r\n",

    "description": "[b]if you are reading this in the nuclear option missio browser, click on \"open steam\"!![/b]\r\n\r\n[b]CALL OF VENGEANCE - 01 LINE IN THE SAND[/b]\r\n\r\nYou are part of the BDF Naval Air Force, launching from carrier groups into a full-scale amphibious invasion. Two fronts. One operation. Absolute chaos.\r\n\r\nThis mission is long, very cinematic with explosions at all time, and unforgiving. If you don’t act, the operation collapses. It’s not impossibly hard, but inactivity will break the operation. \r\n\r\n[b]Overview[/b]\r\nLine in the Sand is a large-scale, realistic amphibious invasion (possibly the most realistic in Nuclear Option history!) Focused on air superiority, strike missions, and sustained close air support, you will launch from carrier groups and choose how to support the operation: assist the western beach assault or strike targets around the eastern port.\r\n\r\nThis is not a scripted, on-rails mission. Objectives exist on both fronts, and ignoring one side leads to failure. Success depends on your priorities, timing, and coordination. The mission includes subtle dynamic events and hidden systems that most players won’t notice, but are there to improve realism and player agency.\r\n\r\n[b]Your Role[/b]\r\nDominate the airspace. Enemy air defenses are dense and layered, requiring persistent effort to suppress and destroy. Protect friendly bombers and transports, then maintain pressure with strike runs and CAS to secure landing zones and follow-on forces. Our overarching objective is liberating North Boscali Airbase and Maris airport. \r\n\r\nOnce forces are on the ground, CAS becomes critical. Anything threatening the beachhead, convoys, or airborn assaults is your responsibility\r\n\r\n[b]Objectives & Features[/b]\r\n• Two carrier groups supporting separate axes of attack.\r\n• Multiple major objectives and dozens of optional or high-risk objectives.\r\n• Freedom to choose which front to support. Western front demands precision; eastern front is more forgiving.\r\n• [b]Optional objectives[/b]: Eliminate enemy command bunkers to cripple coordination, capture oil rigs, secure ballistic missile storage/sub pens, destroy Kramenka Industries, capture cargo ships, airlift air defense missile launchers, liberate factories, seize North Boscali Airbase and Maris Airport, and more.\r\n• Dynamic events: Ambushes, fallback objectives if key assets are destroyed, timeouts for optional objectives, and other hidden improvements for quality-of-life and realism.\r\n• Fully playable solo or in co-op. Difficulty scales dynamically with player count.\r\n• Extensive use of carrier aviation, bombers, and transport aircraft.\r\n• Replayable structure: Player choices dramatically affect difficulty, flow, and mission pacing.\r\n\r\n[b]Mission Timeline & Environment[/b]\r\n• Operation begins at 0600, partly cloudy skies with cloud base at 1400m.\r\n• Eastern and western fronts progress independently; your choices determine which front completes objectives first.\r\n• Objectives can be tackled in different orders, but poor timing or coordination will be punished.\r\n\r\n[b]Length & Difficulty[/b]\r\n• Solo: ~2 hours for skilled players.\r\n• Co-op: ~1 hour or more depending on coordination. \r\n• Constant pressure, heavy air defenses, and nonstop action.\r\n\r\nControl the air, and the line holds. Fail, and it breaks.\r\n\r\n[i]oh hi these are just some search tags no need to read them[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]really,stop[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]STOP[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]fine[/i]\r\n\r\namphibious assault\r\nPvE\r\nfriends\r\ncarrier aviation\r\nnaval air force\r\namphibious landing\r\ncombined arms\r\nair superiority\r\nclose air support\r\ncarrier strike group\r\nlarge scale battle\r\ncinematic mission\r\nlong mission\r\nco-op mission\r\nsolo friendly\r\nreplayable\r\nhigh player agency\r\ndynamic objectives",

This skin includes a recreation of what seems to be a commemorative artwork that has been seen on various KPAF aircraft beneath the canopy of the aircraft. ",

    "description": "ok heres the important stuff\r\n\r\n[b]FEEDBACK IS HIGHLY APPRECIATED[/b]; This mission's development has almost entirely relied on feedback and survey from the community. i read [i]everything[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]Rearming your carrier and destroyer is an extremely powerful boon:[/b] Simply having them armed allows for both long range ir defense (mmrs, stratolances, etc.) which is incredibly helpful if you wanna keep your carrier or destroyer alive. [b]Rearming the destroyer means free cruise missiles[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]THIS MISSION IS MADE FOR MULTIPLAYER: [/b]More specifically, mid-large size multiplayer servers, but playing with little people or alone will both be incredibly boring and weak. the ai in this game is retarded, don't rely on them as a proper enemy\r\n\r\n[b]LYNCHPINS ARE YOUR FRIEND: [/b]Lynchpins are incredibly cheap, and incredibly easy to kill enemy ground units with. You probably already knew this, but a ton of people don't\r\n\r\n[b]USE NUKES WISELY!!!!! NUKE PRODUCTION IN THIS MISSION IS SLOW!!!!!! [/b]It may seem redundant, but two bombs of 1.5kts can literally end the game. For reference, nuke production is 3 nukes every 1500 seconds\r\n\r\nok thats probably all the important stuff\r\n\r\n[h1]Mission Summary[/h1]\r\n[b][i]A single highway linking the North Boscali and Maris airbases sets the stage for an intense, and seemingly endless ground war. Along the way, you'll find numerous vehicle depots, air defenses, helipad FOBs, and a wide variety of ground vehicles. Add the heavily fortified coastlines, and even complemented by a destroyer and carrier for each team, and you'll find many opportunities for different playstyle. With a finely-tuned economy in play, each player absolutely must think strategically, leveraging their team's aircraft production to exploit and whittle the enemy's ground, air, and sea superiority; thanks to the air production being placed in the back towards the air bases, as long as the factories stay somewhat alive, you'll always strive the same.\r\n\r\nThe only objective? Destroy the enemy's factories. [/i][/b]\r\n\r\nheres my design philosophy stuff i wrote and posted on the discord if you wanna read it (note that as of 0.29.3, half of this is essentially voided thanks to the reserve system finally being fixed)\r\n\r\nThis mission supports and rewards both casual and competitive gameplay; If you die alot, play slowly or at your own pace, you'll still have as many airframes as you'd like (assuming you have the factory production to keep up with it), and not be far behind the general playerbase by reserving chicanes; however, playing consistently well, getting kills, surviving, etc or just being a skilled player, you'll be ahead of everyone else economically, in rank, and in airframes \r\nThis mission also supports and rewards different playstyles: While you may initially think of using the southern waterway to push or fly over the middle road, the mountain and the north flank are both opertunities to choose from; there are also plenty of airspace with both defensive and offensive geography to do CAP, more than enough vehicles and buildings along the road to do CAS, plenty of radars to do SEAD, do whatever the hell you want, the choice is yours \r\nThe economy and production in this mission have been refined and iterated dozens and [i]dozens[/i] of times. the production especially, has been set up to scale with aircraft price. Reserving one expensive airframe will still have the combined reserve time of a bunch of cheaper airframes, so reserving an expensive airframe will have about the same weight as reserving a cheaper airframe. The only and biggest reason you have to rank up and reserve more expensive airframes is the power to have exclusive reserves; while all the rank 2s might be reserving compasses and chicanes, as a rank 4 you'll be able to reserve medusas and ifrits privately, not having to deal with the increased demand. Economy has also recieved similar tweaks; you WILL lose money, reserves, and time if you die.\r\nFinally, this mission supports and rewards teamwork; you can choose what to do, but having people fill needed roles over different fronts of the map can absolutely lead to an easier victory; flying a sortie with a buddy can lead to way more increased survivability\r\n\r\n\r\nshoutout to The Worst Pilot Ever, BelkaAlex, Mobius 6, and all the regulars who've been playing on my servers and missions, especially those who give the feedback needed to move this mission towards balance and being fun :)",

    "description": "Welcome to Escalation Expanded. This is a performance heavy mission, adding several new locations to Escalation and expanding the size of battle. It features roughly double the amount of factory production buildings, a naval port for both sides, a new coastal airbase for both sides, adds landing pads to the cities, and 2 civilian production centers that are also aiding in the war effort. Balance has been tested very little, but either side can still win. Each side has a manually commanded carrier fleet along with the default carrier fleet. Enjoy the chaos :)\r\n\r\nIf you want you can check this video out right here by RNTZH690: https://youtu.be/YKQTeZ6NaCs\r\n",

    "description": "[h2]Your parcel is on hold due to an unexpected Combined Arms Company. Please verify your credentials while we address this threat...[/h2]\r\n\r\n[i]\"By 2082, Australia Post is no longer just a civilian logistics giant - it’s a neutral lifeline in a fractured world. As conflicts between the BDF and PALA turn entire regions into contested airspace, AusPost expands its charter to include guaranteed delivery, even in active warzones. When satellites are jammed, runways are cratered, and supply lines are cut, the sight of a red VH-49 Tarantula dropping out of the clouds means essentials are still moving: APCs, mobile radars, ammunition crates and yes - mail.\r\n\r\nOutfitted with hardened avionics and flown by contract crews who know how to ride the edge of SAM envelopes, AusPost Tarantulas operate under strict neutrality. Neither BDF nor PALA officially trusts them, but both quietly rely on them. In a future where wars are fought at supersonic speed, the oldest promise still holds: if it absolutely has to get there - Australia Post will deliver...three weeks late.\"[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]Author's notes:[/b] This is my first time making a livery. As such, I apologise for any imperfections or amaturistic qualities.\r\n\r\n[h3]Credits[/h3]\r\nTemplate weathering and decals gratiously provided by pheonix1509\r\nThanks to javiairplane, Nikkorap, radiumio and Shumatsu0 from the Nuclear Option discord server for their patience in teaching me.",

The solution was to apply a temporary washable paint over the dark green on the LCS scheme and despite concerns, it was found to have a neglible effect on RCS. Due to its temporary nature, ground crews are often 'creative' in its application.\"\r\n\r\nArctic variation of the  AV-8B Land Camouflage Scheme for BDF Vortexes based on a real practice used to convert the woodland camo on RAF and USMC Harriers to an arctic camo for winter and arctic exercises.",

It attempts this by doing the following:\r\n\r\nTaking objectives away from large bases and instead spreading them out into the map. Objectives will no longer be within the most heavily defended areas of the map.This will hopefully turn things into less of a slog.\r\n\r\nThe primary mission objective is to push the enemy completely off of the main island and eliminate their infrastructure.\r\n\r\nEach team starts at one side of the islands with most of their heavy ground forces further away.\r\n\r\nOther things: crickets are out of the equation, you can still buy one of you want, but compass production should mean you are never trying to cross an ocean with only a cricket.\r\n\r\nMore expensive aircraft factories have limited production and are very exposed to enemies. Losses of high end aircraft will not be replaced by factories. Keep your Ifrit safe or you'll have to pay for it.",

This can help turn a very unfavorable session into a rather easy one!\r\n\r\nOnce 30 minutes are over, the counter-attack phase begins, which will then end the mission in victory once completed.\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\n--- Small Update ---\r\n\r\n- Removed a hidden easter egg on player HUDs.

Enjoy 20mg of dry-frozen pineapples with each purchase instead.\n\nArrivederci, Bon appetit, Bis bald, and many other silly one-liners to use against your foes.",

    "description": "Achieve total control over Boscali in the third and final day of a simulated conflict in an exercise locked in a brutal stalemate.\r\n\r\nThe second mission in the Spring in Boscali series, and the penultimate mission before the release of the mainline trilogy. Focusing heavily on air to ground combat and urban warfare, Breakthrough pits the KPAF and BDF against each other in a fight over control of Heartland's population and industrial centers, while also presenting a more story based experience than Naval Skirmish, albeit still with a focus on enjoyable gameplay.\r\n\r\nBreakthrough serves as a demonstration of logic and multiple endings in the Nuclear Option mission editor, along with a take on a balanced yet uneven mission layout. \r\n\r\nIntended Play Order:\r\nNaval Skirmish > Breakthrough > Primevan Spring > Vanguard > Dawn (currently unreleased) > Dusk (currently unreleased) > Counterforce (currently unreleased) > Inferno (currently unreleased) > Midnight (currently unreleased)\r\n\r\n[h2] Known Issues [/h2]\r\n\r\nThe logic system for detecting nuclear detonations may be prone to false positives, please let me know if you end up accidentally triggering the nuclear detonation dialogue via conventional strike.\r\n\r\n[strike] With the addition of map objects to the objective system in 0.32, the fast capturing system should hopefully now work a little better in pvp multiplayer matches, but may still be slow for some people. Let me know if it needs to be changed. [/strike] Update, turns out hangars at North Boscali and Dustbowl are bugged, and will instantly trigger the fast capture system despite not being destroyed by player action. Expect the fast capture system to be broken until Shockfront fixes the issue, which I have privately brought up with one of the developers.\r\n\r\n[h2] Extras [/h2]\r\n\r\n[url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/18c6C56NBTInMfV5nf-9H_NV4UNnDrPAIqkBx282Xi_U/edit?usp=sharing] Spring in Boscali Lore Document [/url] \r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3503215059] Spring in Boscali Collection [/url]",

This was worn by B-52D's while the SIOP camo was worn by other active models. \r\n\r\nThis is my first skin so it would be greatly appreciated if you could provide a bit of feedback in the comments :)",

Now you can!\r\n\r\nA pretty chill mission, where you have to intercept a LOT of Darkreaches with an aircraft of your choosing before they reach Harmony Sands. Just so it won't become a missile spam mission, none of 'em are available, meaning all you have is ratatata and brrrrt :D\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nThis is a relatively easy mission if you try to aim a little and don't just spray 'n' pray. But those of you who want a bit of a challenge, you can choose other planes.\r\n( Difficulty order from easiest to hardest: Ifrit, Revoker, Vortex, Compass. (i dont think it's possible to shoot all of them down with the Compass... although feel free to prove me wrong.) )\r\n\r\nThis mission doesn't connect to any of my future missions in mind, and isn't realistic either.\r\n\r\nPS.: preview image doesnt show all Darkreaches >:)\r\n\r\nEdit: Thank you guys for the support! On a side note, its apperantly possible with the Compass and people say its the easiest... oh well, guess im just bad with it lol, have fun!",

I updated it to match my current standarts.\r\n\r\nA little background on camouflage: Anatoly Serdyukov, former Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation decided to standardize the livery of the Air Force with reference to the US Air Force. The result was the “Eggplant” or unofficially “Serdyukov's” livery. It began it's use on the Su-30SM, Su-35S, Su-34, etc. After the change of the Minister of Defense, the paint scheme was deemed unsuccessful and was no longer applied to new airframes.\r\n\r\nLivery for FS-12 Revoker.

    "description": "Tanky Tank has been tasked with a decissive, heroic, aepic, but also suicidal, mission. It, and It alone, must capture Evil BDF´s K92 outpost. Ofc, those Treacherous BDF guys are not willing to let Tanky Tank fullfil its mission, and are cowardly hiding waiting to ambush and destroy poor Tanky Tank.\r\n\r\nAny other would call it madness and desert, but Tanky Tank (as any ground troop on NucOp) knows no fear. In fact, it only knows about marching forward on the assigned lane and shooting things on range. And thats what Tanky Tank gonna do!\r\n\r\nThankfully, maybe there are some good-hearted pilots wich can bring air support to Tanky Tank, so its suicidal march into the enemy may become a unexpected and major victory, against all odds.\r\n\r\nGo forth, Tanky Tank! we got you covered! (hopefully...?)\r\n\r\n-This mission is designed for COOP, can be adjusted to play solo, I guess (increase allied AI / decrease enemy AI)\r\n\r\n-Tanky Tank deploys at start slighty north from player´s airstrip. Its the only friendly tank out there, so not hard to find.\r\n\r\n-Tanky Tank reaching and capturing designed location wins the game.\r\n\r\n-Tanky Tank being destroyed, is instant Game Over.\r\n\r\n-Early version, subject to changes. Please leave feedback on comments, thanks!",

    "title": "[v0.8] Expanded Escalation - Co-op BDF",
    "description": "[i] //Primavera nears victory, its forces pushed to their limits in their advance north. An opportunity now arises for a battered Boscali reverse its fortunes against an exhausted PALA. Take to the skies as a PMC for the BDF, seize victory from the jaws of defeat, and become the stuff of legend.// [/i] \r\n\r\n[b] MISSION OVERVIEW [/b]\r\n\r\nThis is a challenging, long form mission that will test your ability to destroy large numbers of enemies and resist a more streamlined and deadly PALA ground/air force, all while managing limited (but not scarce) funds/airframes. \r\n\r\nMission starts you at Rank 2, however further rank increases are HIGHLY tied to your ability to complete sorties (and rescue downed friendly pilots). Almost no EXP can be gained via kills alone. \r\n\r\nEstimated to take ~3-4 hours to complete depending on team coordination, number of players, and player experience. Hosting this mission as a co-op game (with ~8-10 human players for performance reasons) is STRONGLY advised. On solo, the mission can take around ~5hrs to complete. \r\n\r\nAs the mission is still being actively worked on and refined, any feedback is appreciated! (I can only do so much testing on my own given the mission's size.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[b] IMPORTANT INFORMATION [/b]\r\n\r\n- While there are objective markers to direct you, this mission is able to be played and completed out of order. In fact, there are even small incentives to doing so. (For example, if Vigil Cay Naval Airbase and Vigil Cay Naval Yard are captured before PALA can launch the docked ships, then BDF will be able to use them. Neutral ships at PALA bases can also be destroyed to prevent them from launching later on.) Additionally, there are \"hidden\" bases that can be capped by air-dropped units. These bases are generally meant to be austere points from which rotary/VTOL aircraft can either forward deploy from and/or resupply at. (So far the \"hidden\" bases consist of: Calyx Radar Mountain Complex, Guard Station Alucian, Edith Rock Naval Base, FOB Knock Out, Guard Station Opal Eye, Guard Station Casino, Guard Station Evergreen, Comona Naval Supply Station, Guard Station Gregorien, Agripol Airbase Radar Site, Rex Mons Support Facility, Site T-34R, Schezna Mountain Research Facility, Site P-41N, FOB Garrote. More will be added in future updates. When captured, they will spawn friendly BDF units around them.) \r\n\r\n- Due to the large amount of units and structures, this scenario is very CPU and GPU intensive. As of 20 Nov 2025, [b] my laptop's specs are: Ryzen 9 7940HS, x2 16GB DDR5 RAM, RTX 4060 (laptop based GPU).[/b] With \"Wrecks Despawn Time\" set to 20min and \"Max Number of Wrecks\" set to 150, I get around a 40-50FPS average (30FPS 1% lows and 20-25FPS 0.01% lows) at the start of the match, sometimes dipping to around 20FPS average (5-10FPS 1% lows and 0-5FPS 0.01% lows) at the scenario's most intense moments. That performance is when playing the scenario with all of its setting as-is upon download. This is important because, for example, adding in any clouds to the scenario will to drop the average FPS by around 5-10FPS (at least on my computer). You may have better performance on a computer with superior hardware and can feel free to adjust the setting accordingly. (I am constantly trying to increase performance on the map without compromising on the scale of the scenario.)\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n[b] UPDATE 9 JANUARY 2026 \r\n\r\nCHANGES: [/b]\r\n\r\n- Minor updates to PALA force distribution, type, and amount. \r\n\r\n- Other small changes I can't recall :| ...........\r\n\r\n\r\n[b] TO DO: [/b]\r\n\r\n- Find workaround/fix for objectives which utilize a \"None\" Faction setting to function in previous updates.\r\n\r\n- Expand dialogue instances in scenario.\r\n\r\n- Add \"scripted\" events.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b] KNOWN ISSUES: [/b]\r\n\r\n- Airbase capture objectives that have their Faction setting set to \"None\" now no longer function correctly. Capturing airbases/FARPS/FOBs that utilized these objectives now no longer spawn BDF \"capture\" units. Objectives cannot have their Faction setting assigned as Boscali, because the AI ground units will attempt to drive to and capture these bases, some of which are located high up mountains, leading to AI ground units getting stuck while going offroad.\r\n\r\n- Performance/FPS loss when large numbers of munitions are launched (ex: Dynamo destroyer launching cruise missiles; Tarantula gunship firing sustained 76mm barrage), or when large numbers of AI or player aircraft are active. (A maximum of 10 human players and x5 AI aircraft appears to skirt the line of minimum acceptable performance for midrange PCs.)\r\n\r\n- Vehicles spawning in air or \"wandering\" the map (at mission or objective start).\r\n\r\n- BDF and PALA units spawning and disappearing out of nowhere due to objectives and outcomes being linked improperly.",

    "description": "Avez-vous déjà regardé le FS-12 Revoker et vous êtes-vous dit \"On dirait vaguement un mélange entre un Rafale et d'autres trucs et avec un seul moteur comme un Gripen ou un Mirage\" ? Et votre fibre francophile vibre-t-elle à l'appel d'un avion français ?\r\n\r\nEt bien il se trouve que j'avais déjà réalisé [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3470934183]une livrée pour le Revoker inspirée des Mirage 2000-5F de l'armée de l'air[/url]. Or il se trouve que certains de ces 2000-5F ont été remis à l'armée de l'air ukrainienne pour servir à la défense de l'espace aérien ukrainien. Une vidéo récente de celle-ci m'a permis de constater que les Mirages ukrainiens, qui défendent régulièrement les populations civils des frappes indiscriminées et meutrières de drones et missiles russes, utilisent encore la livrée française \"classique\" de défense aérienne. Elle a même encore ses marquages en langue française.\r\nVoici donc une reprise de ma livrée à l'origine française du Revoker mais désormais pour mettre à l'honneur l'armée de l'air ukrainienne.\r\n\r\n[i]Slava Ukraini ! Heroiam slava ![/i]\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKOwhRQzMg\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nHave you ever looked at the Revoker and asked yourself \"This airframe looks like a mix of a Rafale with other things and with a single engine like a Gripen or Mirage\"? And does your francophile fiber yearns for a French aircraft?\r\n\r\nWell, I made [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3470934183]a livery for the Revoker inspired by the Mirage 2000-5F of the French Air and Space force[/url]. And some of these Mirages have actually made their way to the Ukrainian Air Force to assist in defending Ukrainian airspace. A recent video made me realize that the Ukrainian Mirages, that are regularily deployed to defend civilians from indiscriminate and murderous Russian drone and missile strikes, still use the standard French air defense blue livery, complete with markings in French.\r\nAnd so here is my original French livery remade to honor the Ukrainian Air Force.\r\n\r\n[i]Slava Ukraini ! Heroiam slava ![/i]\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKOwhRQzMg",

The sailor was tied to a line looped beneath the vessel, thrown overboard on one side of the ship, and dragged under the ship's keel, either from one side of the ship to the other, or the length of the ship (from bow to stern).\r\n\r\nI wanted to create something with a realistic, lore accurate feel.

For Optimization.\r\n\r\n- South Boscali (Home base) has its laser count reduced from 3, down to 1.\r\n\r\n- Initial aircraft reserves have been tweaked. From 16 Crickets down to 4 Crickets and 2 Ibis'.\r\n\r\n- Enemy Bomber + Vortex wave has been slightly tweaked. Some Darkreaches now have PAB-250LRs. The Vortex's no longer have Scythes. Only IRSM-2s for air attacks.\r\n\r\n- The Revoker squadron Bonus has now been reworked into a Periodical Squadron support bonus. Instead of Revokers, you get various different aircraft squadrons every few minutes. Up to 5x waves of allies.\r\n\r\n- One of the starting factories at South Boscali now spawns Brawlers every 200 seconds.\r\n\r\n- The initial Cricket Factory at South Boscali now spawns Crickets at a reduced rate. From 90 seconds to 150 seconds.",

This 1.2 update is recommended to be played with either 3x skilled players or 6+ decent players.\r\n\r\n--- UPDATE CHANGES FOR 1.2 RELEASE ---\r\n\r\n-New Bonus objective that rewards a rapid A-19 Brawler Factory\r\n\r\n-A couple of allied Brawlers start off with the rest of the allied Compass' on mission start\r\n\r\n-Number of enemy laser trailers have been nerfed to 4 in total. A message plays when all are destroyed.\r\n\r\n-Reduced the amount of enemy Anvils near South Boscali\r\n\r\n-Reduced the amount of enemy aircraft per air wave\r\n\r\n-Added an enemy Ibis wave\r\n\r\n-Lowered normal AI aircraft count to 8 per side. Doesn't affect the usual wave NPCs, but still helps with performance\r\n\r\n-No more turbulence\r\n\r\n-One of the Northern Shards now spawns closer\r\n\r\n-The allied Shard spawns have been buffed to include more shards per wave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--- UPDATE CHANGES FROM THE ORIGINAL 1.0 RELEASE ---\r\n\r\n-BONUS Airbases now display what they each bring as allied support.\r\n\r\n-The \"BONUS: CAPTURE\" HUD marker no longer sticks around after capture\r\n\r\n-Allied Bonus factories now produce airframes at a slower rate\r\n\r\n-Enemy team now has much more air presence, due to more air factories. Ibis's, Chicanes, Revokers and Crickets will be far more present.\r\n\r\n-Restricted Radar Air to Air missiles for the enemy team. This way, Revokers aren't extremely annoying throughout the match.\r\n\r\n-The South Destroyer has been moved slightly behind a hill to prevent immediate attacks on your starting base. Also 2x Shards will accompany the Destroyer.\r\n\r\n-2x Additional BONUS airbases can be captured near the enemy South Boscali objective. These are meant for helicopter/logistics pilots.\r\n\r\n-An additional BONUS objective is present later on in the match. A stationary Destroyer, which will spawn another Allied Destroyer + Shards near their base.\r\n\r\n-The enemy airbase 'Maris' will have some AA defenses.\r\n\r\n-Randomly, an allied Revoker squadron will join in temporarily.\r\n\r\n-Allied Vehicle Depots will spawn in during the final attack phase. You can use this to now Donate to Ground Forces, as another way to keep the enemy busy.\r\n\r\n-An artificial platform has been created on your starting island, east side. This can be used for Logistics players to help place AA units to defend the island.",

As fugly as it may be, at least it's more visually interesting than the drab gray used by most other air forces on their combat aircraft.",

I don’t hide the fact that it inspires me, so feel free to follow it instead:[url=https://steamcommunity.com:/linkfilter/?url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3375722440] Link[/url]. I plan to create a series of historical camouflages based on real aircraft. My plans include the Su-57, Saab JAS 39 Gripen, F-14, and others.\r\n\r\nHistorical Background:\r\n\r\nThe Mikoyan Project 1.44/1.42[N 1] (Russian: Микоян МиГ-1.44; NATO reporting name: Flatpack) is a multirole fighter technology demonstrator developed by the Mikoyan design bureau. It was designed for the Soviet Union's MFI (Mnogofunksionalni Frontovoy Istrebitel, \"Multifunctional Frontline Fighter\") project for the I-90 (\"1990s fighter\") program, the answer to the U.S.'s Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF). The MFI was to incorporate many fifth-generation jet fighter features such as supermaneuverability, supercruise, and advanced avionics, as well as some degree of radar signature reduction.\r\n\r\nThe design's development was a protracted one, characterised by repeated and lengthy postponements due to a chronic lack of funds after the collapse of the Soviet Union; the MiG 1.44 made its maiden flight in February 2000, nine years behind schedule, and was cancelled later that year. The MFI project was replaced by the more modern and affordable PAK FA program, which resulted in the Sukhoi Su-57.",

    "description": "Ever wondered what Nuclear Option would look like with comically high winds, strong enough to compete with the strongest hurricanes and tornadoes? Yes? First off, seek help. Second, you've come to the right place. I've absolutely ruined the design of this amazing game by adding horrific winds that turn your plane into that one scene from into the storm where the TIV gets sucked away into the tornado.\r\n\r\nThis is the big boy mode for real gamers. 324 km/h winds blowing directly to the east, stronger than a real life EF5 tornado. The turbulence here can, without exaggeration, rip weaker planes to shreds if you don't fly them well. Good luck, God knows you'll need it.\r\n\r\nThere's some carriers around for easy takeoffs (relatively easy compared to the ground, at least). Do note that chicanes are unusable from the carriers, so you're going to have to take off in those from the ground. Also there's some carriers at the start of the mission that fall from above the Karman Line. Why? I don't know, it was funny I guess. \r\n\r\nBefore you ask, I made this mission with .json editing of the mission file.\r\n\r\nThere's an easter egg somewhere, and a second easter egg within that first easter egg. It'll be funny.",

I want to give credit to __StrafeMike__ for his work he did in War Thunder. I didn't directly contact him, but I referenced his work published to War Thunder live. The attention to detail is immaculate and I've spent a lot of time just enjoying the details of the model in WT. Also want to give credit to Lord Dark Helmet Germany for helping me with the translations. This livery isn't based on a specific aircraft of the unit, it is an emulation of the style. Hope you enjoy, o7!",

Like his squadron mates, he followed Rigel Squadron flight leader Milosz Sulejmani during his desertion to the insurgent group Valahia and later joined the Golden Axe Plan Private Army after the collapse of the Valahia. He, along with the rest of Varcolac Squadron, were killed after being shot down by Antares Squadron. He piloted Tornado IDS, A-10A Thunderbolt II and GAF-1 Varcolac.\r\n\r\nThis livery is a remix/adaptation of A-10 liveries to A-19 since Varcolac squadron livery varies with each game. \r\n\r\nLivery for A-19 Brawler.

Sometimes you'll have to destroy some Shard Corvettes, a Hyperion Carrier or a tank convoy before you're tasked with capturing Maris, Agrapol or South Boscali.\r\n\r\nThere's a good amount of scattered enemy factories that can be hunted to help slow down enemy air and ground production.\r\n\r\nAs usual in my missions, bonus capture objects and targets can be completed for various buffs to your own faction's production.\r\n\r\nEarly on, a neutral Dynamo will spawn on the map. I wouldn't destroy it, unless you have enough players with you to deal with the consequences....\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\n--Update 12/28/2025 --\r\n\r\n-RNG path has now been tweaked further to be randomized properly.\r\n\r\n-Additional BONUS objective that rewards a Brawler factory",

    "description": "Cette livrée nécessite je pense un petit peu de contexte. Après avoir fait, dans l'ordre, le Compass, le Revoker, le Medusa, je voulais réaliser une livrée française pour le Cricket. D'autant plus que c'est souvent le premier avion disponible dans la partie pour les joueurs, et que je l'apprécie fortement pour ce qu'il est, un petit avion d'observation et de contre-insurrection. Mais voilà, je base mes travaux sur des avions existants ou ayant existé dans l'arsenal français, et là comme ça, rien ne me venait. Les Skyraiders utilisés en Algérie notamment ne ressemblent pas du tout au Cricket par exemple. Et la France n'a jamais utilisé d'OV-10 Bronco, source claire d'inspiration pour le Cricket. Et puis mes recherches m'ont fait découvrir le Potez 75.\r\n\r\nBiplace, destiné à l'origine à des missions anti-chars, d'observation et de \"maintien de l'ordre\" (comprendre \"contre-insurrection\" en langage de l'époque), avec une double queue, une gouverne de profondeur en position haute et une unique hélice propulsive. Un unique exemplaire a été produit, au frais du constructeur Potez et prété à l'aviation légère de l'Armée de Terre pour subir une batterie de tests par les armées de Terre et de l'Air. Voilà donc de quoi m'inspirer !\r\n\r\nVous trouverez donc ici une livrée inspirée de l'unique Potez 75 ici portant une livrée bariolée pendant des essais sur des missions de combat en Algérie et avec l'immatriculation civile F-WGVK.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nThis particular livery might require some bits of context. After having made liveries for the Compass, the Revoker, and the Medusa, I wanted to make a French livery for the Cricket. This was especially the case as it often is the first aircraft made available to players in games, and as I quite like the plane for what it is : a small observation and counter-insurgency platform. However, I base my work on actual aircrafts used at some point by France, and here nothing was coming to mind. The Skyraiders used in Algeria do not ressemble the Cricket in any way for example. And France never used OV-10 Broncos, clearly the primary source of inspiration for the Cricket. But then, my research made me discover the Potez 75.\r\n\r\nA two-seater aircraft, intended for anti-tank, observation and counter-insurgency duties, with a twin tail, which included a raised elevator connecting it, and a push propeller. A single unit was built, on Potez company funds and it was loaned to the French Army light aviation for testing by the French Army and Air Force. This was the source of inspiration I was looking for !\r\n\r\nThusly, here is a livery for the Cricket inspired by the only Potez 75 built, here sporting the camouflaged livery used whilst conducting combat tests in Algeria with its civilian tail number F-WGVK.",

There were none on my original, so it looked more gray and blobbish than it does now! After the addition of several wear and detail layers, I've updated the Azrael logo, changed the UV map color tone to better match the real aircraft, and best of all, it's now in 4k! \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this remaster of my first ever livery!\r\n\r\n",

The sailor was tied to a line looped beneath the vessel, thrown overboard on one side of the ship, and dragged under the ship's keel, either from one side of the ship to the other, or the length of the ship (from bow to stern).\r\n\r\nI wanted to create something with a realistic, lore accurate feel. Vanilla+ seems to fit the need for description quite nicely! I created this for my Squadron to use, in multiplayer. I wanted to share it with the rest of the community as well.\r\n\r\n\"Keelhaulers\" is a REAL GROUP and we have a discord server. Check us out and join us if you think you can fly decently.\r\n\r\nThis was my fourth aircraft in the \"Wraith\" Aggressors series of Keelhauler planes.",

    "description": "The 222nd \"Keelhaulers\" is a Mercenary Fighter Squadron and operates for many nations with many aircraft, in many theaters.\r\n\r\nKeelhauling (Dutch\"to drag along the keel\") is a form of punishment and potential execution once meted out to sailors at sea. The sailor was tied to a line looped beneath the vessel, thrown overboard on one side of the ship, and dragged under the ship's keel, either from one side of the ship to the other, or the length of the ship (from bow to stern).\r\n\r\nI wanted to create something with a realistic, lore accurate feel. Vanilla+ seems to fit the need for description quite nicely! I created this for my Squadron to use, in multiplayer. I wanted to share it with the rest of the community as well.\r\n\r\n\"Keelhaulers\" is a REAL GROUP and we have a discord server. Check us out and join us if you think you can fly decently.\r\n\r\nPhoto credit to Owl_cornate/ Maritime Horse\r\n\r\nStay tuned for the rest of the aircraft roster!\r\n\r\n-MOBIUS",

Just me, with a cricket, with nothing but machine gun pods and lynchpins, hugging the ground just wiping out every SAM and SPAAG i came across. I survived long enough to go back and re-arm 4 or 5 times\r\n\r\nI'm still not fantastic at the game or anything, and for a lot of the time first playing, SPAAGs and Stratolances were my nightmare, so when I survived 4 or 5 runs just wiping a bunch out across a huge stretch of land, i felt accomplished and wanted to make a livery for that moment. it felt good",

    "description": "EXERCISE BRIPAL 2024: OPERATION GRINDSTONE\r\n\r\nMISSION BRIEFING\r\nOPFOR has taken control of Naval Airbase and Mountain Airbase in a surprise attack, and has had time to construct fortified bases and defenses in preparation for a BLUFOR counterattack. However, due to a successful evacuation and planned retreat, BLUFOR's forces are perfectly positioned to break through as hostile forces have spread themselves too thin. BLUFOR— that's us— will form a spearhead to push through FOXTROT PASS, the southern path to Mountain Airbase.\r\n\r\nFOB Oasis will be the ground assault's first target. OPFOR has made a critical error constructing a logistics outpost so close to enemy territory, and must now commit its forces to defending at length against the full brunt of our firepower. Once FOB Oasis is taken, BLUFOR will have all the foundation it needs to launch a full-scale assault on multiple fronts. To organize this assault, we've identified three key mission objectives:\r\n\r\nOPERATION DERVISH RED\r\nOPFOR's main fuel reserve has been moved close to the frontlines to simplify enemy logistics, but it is heavily defended by electronic warfare and air defense units. Performing a raid in this area will draw defenders away from the main attack and reduce their ability to counterattack. Lancer Squadron will provide scouting and electronic support to counter the presence of enemy jammers in the area while our special forces unit infiltrates the nearby airfield. \r\n\r\nOPERATION HAMMER BLUE\r\nThe crown jewel of OPFOR's fleet is the XC-02L Lampade-R air cruiser, which also made an appearance in last year's exercises and underwent a refit based on the exercise's combat data. The new Lampade-R features multi-purpose mission modules and a revamped flight deck, allowing it to suppress our air units from extreme distance. Splashing this asset will be top priority for Objective B. Gazer Signal Battalion has been assigned to track the Lampade's movements from FOB Oasis.\r\n\r\nOPERATION OHLONE GREEN\r\nSatellite imagery and geological scans have identified the construction of a fortified underground railway system through the mountain range near Mountain Airbase, and at least two armored trains have been seen transiting the tunnels to provide overwatch over Foxtrot Pass. As the HQ lies directly in the path of our units, it must be destroyed. Golem Battalion will be the spearhead for this operation as well as the final push to Mountain, so providing support for them will be the top priority for Objective C.\r\n\r\nCompletion of at least two of the three key mission objectives is necessary to open up the path to Mountain Airbase. Do not hold back; Take back our home at all costs.",

This particular skin has the bort number 205, belonging to Elke van Dalsen, aka \"Scream\".\r\n\r\nThis skin is not faction locked, which, since these siblings are treacherous mercenaries, is kinda fitting anyway.",

    "description": "[UPDATED FOR 0.32]\r\n\r\nEntrenched deep in the mountain side and manufacturing high grade nuclear weapons, the BDF find themselves under siege by PALA forces. With the odds stacked against you, prepare to thwart off wave after wave and declare yourselves... The Elevation Czars\r\n\r\n\r\nThis a 3 wave defense mission which depending on play should last roughly an hour. Featuring the well defended and packed city of Maris, covered in dense AA systems and pillboxes. The so called \"Kingdom Come\" mountain base, made for expedited take off of bombers and overlooking the map. with 2 smaller forward bases with more to come. Gently float down the mountain range into combat over the \"Bowl\". Tucked away behind a peninsula is Outpost Victory. Almost every base at every elevation has an airfield, with cramped industrial and high rise corridors that serve as both cover and challenge for pilots. Optimal player count is roughly 8 players.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to play this as the attackers or use the mission for PVP, its a simple edit in the editor. You can also edit other variables to your liking i.e. vehicle and weapon bans. Until its fully completed I will refrain from uploading them myself. Id have to change each upload individually which would be quite a task.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned additions: Even more FOBs and hidden PALA outpost. Weirder bases when future pathfinding updates permit it.",

    "description": "After the victories in the Heartland, BDF command moved outward to secure further assets captured by PALA forces. The first of which, was the Ignus Archipelago, a key strongpoint in the major vicinity, with multiple airbases and possible shoreline defense positions. As expected, this was next in line for BDF interests. Unfortunately, PALA units have set up a nearly impenetrable shoreline defense at Hogshead Airstrip. In response, BDF deployed their amphibious assault units and nearby troops stationed in the bases that have held out the initial offensive by PALA forces. PALA forces have the west of Feldspar secured, DO NOT APPROACH this area until ground units have destroyed the surrounding Anti-Air. In addition, we must fully secure the city Feldspar in order to continue our advances.\r\n\r\n...Again, it is crucial that we win this battle, as we will need the archipelago to continue our advances. Any questions? Good. [Transmission cut]\r\n\r\nATTENTION ALL UNITS: IRBMS ON STANDBY. AWAITING ORDERS FROM COMMAND.\r\n\r\nThis mission will not be easy whatsoever, effectively nothing like part 1 in terms of difficulty. PALA WILL be a force to be reckoned with, and WILL do everything in it's power to defend it's positions.\r\n\r\nMission length: ~2 hours with no player intervention. Sit back and watch the action, or jump in!\r\n",

It is ready for a test flight, but PALA seems to want to interrupt you with an experiment of their own.\r\nDefend your base and the future of the prototype against the unending convoy and waves of enemies!\r\n\r\nFAQ/known issues:\r\nWhy is the prototype permanently lost when I get out?\r\nThis is because of [strike]major issues with the editor devs please fix much love thanks[/strike] deep lore reasons.\r\n\r\nWhat is wrong with the landing ships?\r\nEverything. It is an issue with Nuclear Option itself. For now the ships only serve as a distraction but may sometimes cause a nasty surprise.\r\n\r\nSome tips:\r\n[spoiler]Check which enemy plane has the bombs and which has the cannon (different paint), deal with the cannon first as this will give you more time.\r\nFor the convoy check the icons, it will show which units have machine guns, your defensive positions can help against the other units as they are unarmed.\r\nThe first two checkpoints, especially the first, are not easy to defend at all, keeping yourself alive is more important. The other ones can be enough to survive for the time you need.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nGood critique and feedback is always appreciated.",

The sailor was tied to a line looped beneath the vessel, thrown overboard on one side of the ship, and dragged under the ship's keel, either from one side of the ship to the other, or the length of the ship (from bow to stern).\r\n\r\nI wanted to create something with a realistic, lore accurate feel. Vanilla+ seems to fit the need for description quite nicely! I created this for my Squadron to use, in multiplayer. I wanted to share it with the rest of the community as well.\r\n\r\n\"Keelhaulers\" is a REAL GROUP and we have a discord server. Check us out and join us if you think you can fly decently.\r\n\r\nPhoto credit to Owl_cornate/ Maritime Horse, Stargazer\r\n\r\nStay tuned for the rest of the aircraft roster!\r\n\r\n-MOBIUS",

    "description": "Thank you for Playing: I hope you enjoy this simple, quick, and exciting mission. This is a first attempt at making a mission, so I apologize for any bumps you may experience. Please leave any feedback or things you may feel need improving. Most importantly take some time to familiarize yourself with the real world events and sacrifices that inspired the creation of this mission. \r\n\r\nAssume the role of a AH-64 pilot Callsign Ugly-1, armed with your rotary cannon and AGR-18s. Provide expedient close air support to COP Kahler as they are under fire from heavy weapons, mortar, and Anti tank weaponry. Local insurgents have surrounded the treelines and occupy the hill tops. Intelligence also suggests a presence in the nearby village. Eliminate these threats and provide relief to the COP. Once this has been accomplished and there are no further threats, return to base.\r\n-Good luck \r\n\r\nSingle Player\r\n1x SAH-64\r\n-750 rds 30mm Cannon\r\n-8x AGM-48\r\n-42x AGR-18 Lynchpins \r\n\r\nHistorical information: COP Kahler sits atop a hill in a valley located in the Waygal district of Afghanistan's far eastern Nuristan province. On July 13 2008 200, Taliban insurgents attacked American troops stationed near Quam. The Taliban encircled the remote base and its observation post, attacking it from surrounding farmland. Thus the Battle of Wanat was underway. One of several attacks on remote outposts, the Battle of Wanat has been described as among the bloodiest Taliban attacks of the war. This attack was well-coordinated; fighters across different insurgent groups were able to precisely target key equipment, such as a wire-guided missile launcher, through a sustained and disciplined effort. The initial attack hit the forward operating base's mortar pit, knocking out the 120 mm mortar and detonating the stockpile of mortar ammunition. The insurgents next destroyed the Humvee-mounted TOW missile launcher inside the combat outpost with coordinated fire from unguided RPG rockets. In short order, the base's two heaviest weapons were knocked out, with the subsequent mortar explosion hurling anti-tank missiles into the command base's post. AH-64 Apacheattack helicopters and a Predator unmanned aircraft drone armed with Hellfire missiles arrived over the base about 30 minutes after the battle began. The United States lost 9 servicemembers and sustained 27 wounded. Unconfirmed 65 plus Insurgents were killed during the fighting. \r\n",

The sailor was tied to a line looped beneath the vessel, thrown overboard on one side of the ship, and dragged under the ship's keel, either from one side of the ship to the other, or the length of the ship (from bow to stern).\r\n\r\nI wanted to create something with a realistic, lore accurate feel. Vanilla+ seems to fit the need for description quite nicely! I created this for my Squadron to use, in multiplayer. I wanted to share it with the rest of the community as well.\r\n\r\n\"Keelhaulers\" is a REAL GROUP and we have a discord server. Check us out and join us if you think you can fly decently.\r\n\r\nThis was my Third aircraft in the \"Wraith\" Aggressors series of Keelhauler planes.",

    "description": "The 222nd \"Keelhaulers\" is a Mercenary Fighter Squadron and operates for many nations with many aircraft, in many theaters.\r\n\r\nKeelhauling (Dutch\"to drag along the keel\") is a form of punishment and potential execution once meted out to sailors at sea. The sailor was tied to a line looped beneath the vessel, thrown overboard on one side of the ship, and dragged under the ship's keel, either from one side of the ship to the other, or the length of the ship (from bow to stern).\r\n\r\nI wanted to create something with a realistic, lore accurate feel. Vanilla+ seems to fit the need for description quite nicely! I created this for my Squadron to use, in multiplayer. I wanted to share it with the rest of the community as well.\r\n\r\n\"Keelhaulers\" is a REAL GROUP and we have a discord server. Check us out and join us if you think you can fly decently.\r\n\r\nPhoto credit to Owl_cornate/ Maritime Horse\r\n\r\nStay tuned for the rest of the aircraft roster!\r\n\r\n-MOBIUS",

Let me guess-- it's more accusations of hospital bombings with both sides pointing the finger at each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, It's not as horrendous as that, but... horribly enough, it makes you wonder a bit more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, shoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's word going around that someone spotted an Odonata Revoker during a patrol turned hot.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? They're a civilian-run company from a thousand miles away. They shouldn't be anywhere near a war, especially not this one. On top of that they're not allowed to weapons.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. They do red air training for three or four air forces and neither us-- or the other side-- are part of that list. Supposedly, someone's got footage with them visibly armed, but I haven't heard if they were the ones that fired.\"\r\n",

    "description": "The Santa Fe once had an airline, known as the Santa Fe Skyway. This line lasted about 18 months and used DC-3s and -4s, but now they've purchased surplus BDF VL-49As (they currently use the H variant) to bolster their fleet of 1950s dinosaurs and to provide something most other lines don't: VTOL. This one is Sky Chief Comanche, FAA registration N101925. This is closer to a DC-4 and fictional DC-6 hybrid than an original livery, like the well known Warbonnet scheme.\r\nThis particular line has had a bit of a history with me, being my first ever attempt at a livery (long before the Milwaukee Road Ibis, hell before the first dev stream of the Ibis. My first attempt of this was in early June, and I didn't know about one of the major buttons in Blender, and lost the livery. However, this time, I avenged my former self, and put more quality into it (like decals), which the original never got to. Even through this, I'm still using the 2k resolution base. This will get a remaster one day, along with the KBRMC and MW Ibises, mark my words.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nIdea/Execution: Me\r\nSanta Fe Logos: RailSimStuff .com\r\nDC-6 reference images Planesim .io",

    "description": "En vrai, sans compter les rotors coaxiaux et les turbines propulsives le nouvel UH-90 Ibis a quand même un air de NH-90 Caïman, non ? Même le numéro de modèle semble y faire référence... Et le Caiman est en service dans l'armée de terre et dans la marine nationale. Après avoir fait [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3604627925]une livrée pour représenter les Caracals de l'ALAT[/url], autant en faire une pour représenter celui qui va pour les remplacer. \r\n\r\nAlors voici donc une livrée pour l'UH-90 Ibis inspirée des Caïmans (la version française du NH-90 dans sa variante TTH, [i]Troop Transport Helicopter[/i]) du 1er régiment d'hélicoptères de combat de l'armée de terre.\r\n\r\nERREUR CONNUE : En configuration avec des mitrailleurs de sabord, la texture du sabord droit est inversée, c'est dû à une erreur dans le modèle 3D en lui même et n'est pas corrigeable à mon niveau.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nAlright, the coaxial rotors and the pusher impellers notwithstanding, the new UH-90 Ibis does bear some ressemblance to the NH-90, doesn't it? Even the model numbers seems to be a reference to it as well... And the NH-90 happens to be fielded by both the French Army and French Navy. I have already done [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3604627925]a livery inspired by the Caracal helicopters of the French Army[/url], and the NH-90 just so happens to be replacing them...\r\n\r\nThus here is a livery for the UH-90 Ibis inspired by the NH-90 Caïman (the French version of the TTH, Troop Transport Helicopter, variant of the NH-90) of the 1st combat helicopter regiment of the French Army.\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUE : When equipped with door gunners, the starboard side gunner hatch texture is mirrored. This is due to an error in the 3D model itself that I cannot fix.",

    "description": "A revamped version of the CO-OP mission \"Breakout\".\r\n\r\nThis spinoff features more ships, vehicles and AI aircraft for both sides. Increased enemy ships will attack during the 2nd phase, from multiple angles. Allied ships will periodically spawn during the fight. Heavy CWIS presence are featured on both sides, so players looking to destroy enemy AA/Point Defense units will have a very target rich environment to work with.\r\n\r\nFor balance reasons, Nukes and player flown Darkreaches are restricted.\r\n\r\nOne of the main additions of this version of Breakout, is the ability to bring more allies to the fight by player actions. Your main island factories will only produce Compass' very slowly. BUT, you can capture up to 4x Neutral Airbases to bring new Factories up.\r\n\r\nThese Airbases will spawn a specific aircraft for your AI team. One Airbase will spawn Chicanes, another will bring Ifrits, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are other additions/changes that you'll notice as the defense/attack phases begin. Keep on your toes!\r\n\r\nWhile a very skilled player can beat this alone, it's recommended to have 4x-6x skilled players or 8x+ decent players in this mission variant.\r\n\r\nHappy Hunting!",

    "description": "Partake in a planned strike mission against sprawling fuel storage facilities. 45 minute mission, 1-4 players PVE. Plentiful explosions guaranteed.\r\n[i] Recommended that one plays through in singleplayer first; mission briefing text boxes do not appear properly (?) in multiplayer. [/i]\r\n\r\nStrike enemy fuel facilities before they can finish transferring it to their offshore facilities and carriers! The intensity of the enemy response depends both on the aggression and the breadth of your opening attack; destroying entire gas facilities will reduce the total enemy aircraft population by one plane per facility, whereas damaging facilities partially will instead delay the takeoff of those same aircraft. Failure to dish out enough damage in a short span will result in overwhelming retaliation! \r\n\r\nBalanced for singleplayer, this mission will generally not allow for a lone player to completely pre-emptively smother the enemy response, only partially. However, with 4 skilled players on a team, this mission is designed to be blasted through with extreme efficiency. \r\n",

Eliminating opponent´s Carrier wins the battle.\r\n\r\n-No factories, so while Carriers count with an amazing and unrealistic amount of planes, those are not unlimited.\r\n\r\n-Beware enemy Destroyers, as their Railgun can easily sink a Carrier from afar. Destroyers should be a priority target because of their high treath.\r\n\r\n-Sidequest: May Tanky Tank reach home safely. Go forth, Tanky Tank!",

It is now up to Sicario to press the assault to take back South Boscali from Primeva. Intel reports indicate the presence of underground resistance from forces that were lost or left behind in the city. Or is believed that if the forces occupying the city are destroyed a swift response will be made to capture the city. Currently Primeva has made itself at home there and has moved its forces into the area, act quickly and halt their expansion of forces in the region or we fail to meet our contract specifications.\r\n\r\nThis in my opinion was better than, New Contract - Sicario.

    "description": "This Cricket was originally acquired by UTEX Construction Group through a military surplus program. The advanced cameras and optical equipment made it excel at aerial surveying for border protection construction projects. Its lightweight construction meant it could operate off of unimproved airstrips and sections of highway near the construction sites.\r\n\r\nAs national tension grew and the country hurtled towards civil war, UTEX partnered with their military employers to retrofit the Cricket fleet with the state-of-the-art avionics and weapons systems present on the latest military models. A strafing run by rebels on UTEX field bases prompted the decision to hastily apply field camoflage to the top of the Crickets to help disguise them while parked on the ground.\r\n\r\nToday UTEX Crickets primarily protect UTEX military construction operations and assets. It is not uncommon however for UTEX to use the Cricket fleet to provide close air support for their military partners on offensive operations as well.",

    "description": "Je sais que le FS-20 Vortex est très largement inspiré du Boeing X-32, mais avec son entrée d'air toute particulière et son nez il a un profil qui me rappelle malgré tout un peu le F-8 Crusader. Une version modernisée et rendue \"furtive\" du Crusader certes, mais quand même. C'est d'autant plus vrai je trouve quand il est en configuration lisse, que j'utilise beaucoup personnellement pour exploiter au maximum la grande furtivité du Vortex. Cette configuration lui donne un profil assez ressemblant et elle est cohérente avec le titre \"[i]The Last of the Gunfighters[/i]\" qui avait été donné au Crusader.\r\n\r\nLe Crusader a été employé dans la marine nationale et était embarqué sur porte-avion. Il se trouve d'ailleurs que la France fut le dernier opérateur du F-8 Crusader, les derniers appareils se posant pour la dernière fois en 1999. Vous trouverez donc ici une livrée pour le FS-20 Vortex inspiré de la livrée portée par les F-8 Crusader de la flottille 12F de la marine nationale sur la fin de la vénérable carrière du Crouze.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nI know that the FS-20 Vortex is largely inspired by the Boeing X-32, but with its very peculiar ar intake and its nose it has a side view that reminds me somewhat of the F-8 Crusader. A modernized and stealthier version of the Crusader sure, but still. And I find it even more obvious when it is in a slick configuration, which I personally use quite a lot to fully exploit the Vortex' minimal RCS. In this configuration it ressembles and looks the part for the fighter aircraft that was known as \"The last of the Gunfighters\" in its time.\r\n\r\nThe F-8 Crusader was used by the French Navy and deployed on French aircraft carriers of the time. And it also happens that France was the Crusader's last operator, the last flying airframes making their final landings in 1999. You will find here then a livery for the FS-20 Vortex inspired by the liveries seen on the F-8 Crusader of flotilla 12F of the French Navy as they were nearing their removal from service.",

    "description": "La Marine nationale française et la marine américaine sont les deux seules marines au monde à posséder la capacité de déployer des avions AWACS depuis un porte-avion. Dans la Marine c'est au sein de la flottille 4F que sont affectés les Hawkeye qui fournisse cette capacité.\r\n\r\nJe vous propose donc ici une livrée inspirée par la 4F pour l'EW-25 Medusa qui peut jouer ce rôle d'AWACS dans le jeu.\r\n\r\nNOTE : A ma connaissance il n'est pas (encore ?) possible de texturer le radôme comme on le souhaite. Je n'ai donc malheureusement pas pu y placer la cocarde avec ancre basse visibilité qui y trône fièrement normalement.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nThe French Navy and the US Navy are the only two navies in the world with the capability to deploy AWACS aircraft from their aircraft carriers. In the French Navy the Hawkeye aircraft that provide said capability are assigned to flotilla 4F.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I am offering here a livery for the EW-25 Medusa, which can be used as an AEW aircraft in game, inspired by flotilla 4F. \r\n\r\nNOTE : To my knowledge it is not (yet?) possible to texture at will the rotating radome. As such I am unfortunately unable to put on it the subdued roundel that the 4F usually proudly displays.",

A skilled pilot may be able to complete it deathless. \r\n\r\nPALA nukes fell on the Boscali heartland killing countless in an instant. South and North Boscali have surrendered from PALA's display of force. PALA is claiming jurisdiction and independence for the whole of the Heartland. Corrupt Primevan News are reporting that PALA \"liberated\" the heartland.\r\n\r\nThe BDF Naval interdiction Assault Carrier \"Killing Time\" is approaching the Ignus Archipelago.  South Boscali was nuked to a cinder. The fleet will have to support itself if ity wants to stay alive. Sortie with the BDF Remnant Fleet, an expeditionary force that was on its way to attack Ashwood Island. This island is a training / staging ground of PALAs in the Ignus Archipelago. \r\n\r\nHuge thanks to Drunk Driving Compilation #42, for help with the thumbnail, editing and testing.

For both PALA and BDF\r\n\r\nThe OH-58 was designed as a light recon helicopter with some ground attack ability, working best in a team of 1x Kiowa and 1x Apache. After a long time waiting for official modding support, we finally can bring such a little known but hugely important and much beloved helicopter to Nuclear Option!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* Updated avionics and sensors to the same level as Nuclear Option base aircraft.\r\n\r\n* Fully animated and functional Mast Mounted Sight, with up to 20km of optical detection range.\r\n\r\n* INDIVIDUAL PYLONS; Choose a gun on the left, and lynchpins on the right! or maybe put AGM-48's on both sides, the choice is yours!\r\n\r\n* Detailed flight model based off real OH-58 pilot experiences.\r\n\r\n* 56x IR flares.\r\n\r\n* No jammer (we dont need that, we fly like real men)\r\n\r\n* A Plethora of mix and match loadout options based off IRL OH-58 loadouts.\r\n\r\n* Realistic power to weight ratio loadout/fuel limitations; the Kiowa's engine isnt particularly powerful, a delicate balance between fuel and pylon weight is crucial when deciding the mission.\r\n\r\n*AIR-2 Genie (will be removed from loadout after april fools)\r\n\r\n* A variety of liveries both for PALA and BDF, as well as real world US Army and Taiwanese liveries.",

The first few years were marked by civil unrest and an intensive demilitarization of the country. Following the occupation of Primeva, the few surviving government men and forces were in the very deep water and went into full silent. As former Primevan citizens became undesirable on new BDF territories, some turned to crime, while many others joined the resistance. Various cells employing their own methods to achieve a one goal: returning their country to its rightful citizens.\r\n\r\nOne such cell is the \"Primeva Guard,\" which the player will be a member of. This cell contain most of the \"old soldiers\" and specializes in covert operations, manipulation, while trying to avoid direct confrontation whenever possible. Recently that cell \"acquired\" several companies operating in various sectors, one of the most important being \"Eco-Nuclide,\" a nuclear waste disposal company.\r\n\r\nConvoy Interception takes place in calm and peacful time where resistance activity was on the decline last few years, while Primeva Guard saw an opportunity to strike...\r\n\r\n\"There is increase in recent BDF air traffic activity in the desert region and PALA has given a green light to their top secret black op\"\r\n\r\nSimple and short mission where player is tasked with locating and capturing air convoy by destroying its escort.",

    "description": "Our Ally asked us for help, we answered.\r\nThey provided us with inaccurate information. This caused us to lose 2 ships and 200+ of our country men.\r\nWe need more information, which our Ally's less than helpful neighbor will unwittingly supply.\r\n\r\nNeutralize their radar and capture Tormink NAS.\r\nSpecial forces teams on the ground know what they are looking for.\r\nThis country is not expecting us. Troops stationed here are a combination of reservists and other poorly trained groups.\r\nELINT suggests anywhere from 5-15 aircraft in the air at any time.\r\nTheir airforce is however well funded and well equipped. Keep engagements quick and decisive.\r\nOnce they've detected us, we only have 20 minutes to complete our objectives. Any time beyond that is risking our\r\nNavy and our special forces.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the second level made for a short story giving context to the battles fought in the skies of Boscalia.\r\n\r\nThis mission is expected to take less than 20 minutes to complete.\r\nLow complexity.\r\nBuilt with optional co-op in mind (3 players).\r\n\r\nIf you have feedback or questions about the level creator, leave a comment or message me on Reddit.\r\nu/Blargame",

Currently banning items, bans them from all aircraft.\r\nUnfortunately, there is nothing I can do about this unless the developers add the ability to limit weapons on a per-aircraft basis.",

I made this map initially to play with friends but now you can play it too! I update this map regularly (sometimes multiple times a day, and at least once whenever a major update launches) so make sure you check regularly. Now shown on the map are 3 carrier groups: one in the top left corner of the map (2 carriers, no escorts), one on the bottom right of the map (3 carriers, 15 corvettes and 3 new destroyers totalling 21 ships, it is possible to kill the group but you need multiple people to do so) and one on the bottom center (2 carriers, 4 corvettes and 2 destroyers). All spawnable airfields have munition trucks so they are safe zones to launch from and there is one custom airfield I made (Novorossiysk Airfield, I would recommend deploying from Maris and Vigil Cay until you wipe some enemies). Have fun and invite your friends! (preview shows all enemy locations)",

Under the hood, it has more complex objectives and triggering than Vysota did which let me explore the full possibilities of the system. While short, I don't think it overstays its welcome by any stretch of the imagination. As always, tell me where I f*cked up and we can all have a good laugh about it before I fix it. Cheers!",

There will be NO units reduction and NO \"lowering the difficulty\"[i](that's kinda the point of the mod - to have the highest difficulty possible, UNLESS it's just crashing the game - then I will do something about it)[/i]. Also, due to mission's complex structure, updating the thing may take some time.\r\n\r\n[b]P.P.S.:[/b] Scenario has been published almost a year ago. It has almost 500 unique views and a bit more than 250 unique subscribers...\r\nBUT, for reasons completely unknown to me, it hasn't received even a single bit of feedback, neither I got any while hosting nor joining severs playing the scenario [spoiler](a couple of players did help with gathering information, but that's it)[/spoiler].",

    "description": "[b] This is a revamp of my previous mission, Battle of the Mountains, specifically tailored to keeping the general feel of the mission while reducing entities to improve performance. The map should be a lot better suited for the average PC and be able to sustain around ~60 FPS. [/b]\r\n\r\nThis is a rather wild game of escalation that takes place along the north eastern side of the map. The staple of this mission is the inclusion of two large custom airbases situated on the side of two different mountains. While, given the restrictions of Nuclear Option, you are unable to respawn at these, feel free to use them to rearm. These are heavily defended and difficult to crack.\r\n\r\nThis mission can be played single or multiplayer. Some objectives may ask the player, or give a recommendation towards a new objective. For example, blowing up the munition trucks after taking the first airfield is recommended as your friendly aircraft will try to spawn otherwise. This mission can support up to a 4v4 battle.\r\n\r\nHave fun and enjoy.",

While defending Tokyo alongside the M42 Antares Squadron from the enemy airship Orgoi, he followed his leader Milosz Sulejmani through his desertion to the insurgent group Valahia. Unlike his leader, Kiriakov wasn't as interested with money as he was with flying. He is shown to be bloodthirsty and took battles very seriously, so much so that he sounded distressed when ordered to retreat. He was presumably killed after being shot down by Antares Squadron in the skies above San Francisco. He piloted Su-27, Su-37 and GAF-1 Varcolac.\r\n\r\nThis livery is a once again remix/adaptation of Su-37 liveries to KR-67 since livery varies with each game.\r\n\r\nLivery for KR-67 Ifrit. Available for both factions.\r\n\r\nTags: Ace Combat X2: Joint Assault.",

Aircraft of choice is T/A-30 Compass.\r\nYou will be presented with dialog boxes twice: on briefing and before landing (to spare you some time to prepare for landing).\r\nReport any bugs and post your feedback, i will greatly appreciate it.

PALA forces deployed their fleet to invade Ignus Archipelago, as a good part of their airforce, they did capture Heartland in massive assault days before the assault on Ignus, the remaining BDF forces around the zone want to exploit the assault at Ignus to launch a recapture operation at Heartland while PALA forces are busy.\r\n\r\nMost part of the Radar systems of PALA are down as their aircrafts in the initial assault, so must be necessary to advance as fast as possible and disable the defenses at ground before keep advancing and recapturing the critical points.\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\r\n\r\nIt is centered on Air to Ground combat, will be of course enemy aircrafts but 70% of the difficulty is at the ground, so A-19 and helicopter enjoyers will have fun.\r\n\r\nRecommended at least 6-10 players to not be a really slow progress. This mission is easier than Rising Tsunami but every step and capture takes time.",

Mostly A2G, but expect enemy air assets to respond to your progress. Defend the Maris Enrichment Plant at all costs, while attempting to capture North Boscali Airbase, South Boscali General Aviation and Sandrift.\r\n\r\nYes, the mission is supposed to be challenging for 3 players, just adding bots is not a good alternative, use your basic assets effectively and save the expensive stuff for when it is actually needed! Those free Crickets are your best counter to waves of enemy vehicles.\r\nFly tactically, fight strategically!\r\n\r\nMain changes from V1.0\r\n- Moved Maris buildings and defenses around after map update changed the layout.\r\n- Adjusted some factory production times (less combat units, more Recon), spend some of your cash on ground units.\r\n- FARPs should now let you spawn Helicopters (and small aircraft at Alpha).\r\n\r\nWill do some more play tests (successfully completed previous version with 3-4 players, one joined a bit late).",

Once Vigil Cay is captured, reinforcements will spawn.\r\nYou must defend Vigil Cay at all costs and try not to lose your Hyperion!\r\n\r\nOnce the Island is taken, The player is instructed to complete a set list of objectives, first Boscali General, then Agrapol and so on! Along the way completing side objectives for Rewards and Rank!\r\nOnce objectives are completed, Naval Reinforcements will arrive, use them wisely!\r\n\r\nBalancing may be an issue, feel free to report feedback! -- Seriously, balancing these missions is awkward, any feedback is welcome.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nDue to Balancing, the A-19 is Restricted by default, the enemy AI Cannot use Medusa's or Darkreach's.\r\nNorth Boscali Base and Maris are optional and were set up as a joke, but you are still rewarded to completing them.",

    "description": "---Legacy 0.31 patch---\r\n\r\nYour good old Escalation coop as PALA, but with extra factories and shorter plane construction times for BDF, so it \"shouldn't\" run out of planes so easily... or at all.\r\n\r\nNote this doesn't adds more enemy planes to be flying at once (thats a setting you can customize yourself when creating any game) it just let the AI (BDF) replenish its plane reserves faster so it can keep deploying new planes as current ones are destroyed -instead of reaching a point were AI can just slowly deploy a plane too often on mid to late game.",

Consider it as nothing more than the machinations of the deranged.\r\n_______________________________\r\n\r\nIn 2048, the Republic of Boscali grew increasingly wary of growing foreign interest in the economically prosperous and resource rich Boscalian heartlands, and began to fast-track military development, especially into the fledgling domestic aerospace industry, with the hopes of quickly transitioning their long-neglected air force from a tiny force of early 4th-generation fighters to a fully integrated arsenal of 5th- and 6th-generation aircraft supplemented with revamped 4.5th generation designs.\r\n\r\nA notable endeavor among these projects was the ill-fated Project VECTOR, a collaborative technical program exploring designs and production of thrust-vectoring nozzles conducted by North Boscali Skunkworks and Kramenka Industries, with the end goal of producing a universal 5th-generation air superiority fighter for the mutual defense of Boscali and its trusted ally and neighbor, the Kingdom of Primeva. Funding was mostly provided by the Primevan royal family, who were major stakeholders in Kramenka Industries at the time, while Boscali provided engineers and the use of its facilities at the North Boscali Aerospace Center for testing.\r\n\r\nBetween 2057 to 2063, the R&D team at VECTOR developed a series of prototype airframes (designated XFS-601 to XFS-615) and made a multitude of breakthroughs in materials development and production scale-up of critical components. However, the project abruptly collapsed in 2063 after the mysterious deaths of most of the Primevan royal family and the subsequent outbreak of the Primevan Revolutionary War. Kramenka Industries fell victim to a hostile takeover not long afterwards, and was reborn as the main arms supplier for the rebel Primeva Allied Liberation Front.\r\n\r\nAirframe stress data from the project would later be used in the design of the FS-12 to mitigate increased parts wear while pulling the high-G maneuvers made possible by the Revoker's all-directional vectoring nozzles, and again in the development of the FS-20 Vortex. Meanwhile, cost-effective nozzle designs from the project were recovered by Kramenka Industries and would later be repurposed and successfully integrated into the design of the Kr-67 Ifrit.",

    "description": "A once-mighty empire has abruptly collapsed, leaving behind vast overseas military and industrial assets unattended. A PALA task force has arrived to assess which resources are worth seizing for their own use.\r\n\r\nYet they are clearly not the only interested party here—and the currency for claiming these assets is not gold, but blood and fire.\r\n\r\nA sudden solar flare has disrupted the entire planet, crippling military systems. For air forces, this means radar-guided and inertial navigation weapons are rendered useless. Even the most advanced aircraft are now limited to optically or heat-seeking short-range missiles and unguided bombs.\r\n\r\nPALA’s advance forces have secured Rapierisle Airbase in the southwest and established makeshift logistics to barely sustain frontline fighter losses. PALA Command aims to first capture the artificial island at the northwest corner of the map, where factories capable of producing large aircraft and a naval port with derelict warships may be repurposed.\r\n\r\nIf successful, PALA will push eastward from their foothold in the western seas, seizing key military sites in the central-northern waters and advancing toward a critical island. This zone hosts clusters of factories with immense tactical and strategic value—but rivals are already present. A fierce battle for control looms.\r\n\r\nBDF’s forward outpost is stationed at Cliffline Airbase, a production site for light aircraft, while their heavy aircraft factories lie near the unoccupied Ashwood Airbase in the southeast.\r\n\r\nThe operation is time-capped at two hours—this is a blitz. The faction that dominates the central seas first will gain aircraft production capacity and naval AA networks, an advantage nearly impossible to reverse.",

We believe they might be moving critical resources under cover of the night. It is time critial to eliminate the threat and take out their base aswell. Unfortunately we weren't able to fully equip each jet with a complete payload package. Your wingman's jet only carries a few missiles. He will engage first before returning to base for a resupply. You'll have to take out every other target with your bombs. We don't have intel on the enemy count so choose targets and weapon systems wisely. After your engagement come back to base and clear the runway immediately for our spy plane. Good luck.",

Second, you've come to the right place. I've absolutely ruined the design of this amazing game by adding horrific winds that turn your plane into that one scene from into the storm where the TIV gets sucked away into the tornado.\r\n\r\nThis is the less extreme of the two comical winds missions, with wind speeds of 216 km/h blowing directly to the east.\r\n\r\nThere's some carriers around for easy takeoffs (relatively easy compared to the ground, at least). Do note that chicanes are unusable from the carriers, so you're going to have to take off in those from the ground. Also there's some carriers at the start of the mission that fall from above the Karman Line. Why? I don't know, it was funny I guess. \r\n\r\nBefore you ask, I made this mission with .json editing of the mission file.\r\n\r\nThere's an easter egg somewhere, and a second easter egg within that first easter egg. It'll be funny.\r\n\r\nBlame Shib.",

    "description": "Ever wanted a sort of horde mode but with planes?\r\n\r\nBoscali, in an attempt to make up a shortage of combat planes and overwhelm Primeva, has converted several of their factories to produce an overwhelming number of low cost aircraft and light vehicle chassis. Perhaps, too many factories at the cost of lacking more advanced aircraft and tougher linebreaker models. Can they overwhelm the now technologically superior PALA with hordes of cheap aircraft and vehicles?\r\n\r\nUnlike the pre workshop versions, this version is mostly balanced and meant for PvP.

Et le Brawler a deux moteurs à hélice (ok des turbofan, pas des turboprop mais passons :P) comme une famille d'avions de patrouille maritime bien connue de nos marins : les Atlantic et Atlantique 2.\r\n\r\nDonc voici une livrée pour le A-19 Brawler très librement inspirée des Atlantic et Atlantique 2 qui ont ou qui servent encore dans la flottille 21F de la Marine Nationale.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nWell, there you have yet another livery based on a a very stretched definition of \"ressemblance\" :D I often find myself using the Brawler in shore strikes such as in support of combined air and amphibious operations, and even in naval strikes directly. Furthermore the Brawler has two propellers (sure they are propfans, not turboprops, but close enough :P), just like a family of maritime patrol aircrafts well known and beloved by French sailors : the Atlantic and Atlantique 2.\r\n\r\nAnd so here is a livery for the A-19 Brawler loosely inspired by the Atlantic and Atlantique 2 that used to be or that are still actively operated by the French Navy Flotilla 21F.",

Mais bon, l'A-19 est particulièrement utile en jeu et il méritait bien d'avoir aussi droit à sa livrée française. Et puis en plus elle était attendue de certains avec lesquels je joue ;)\r\n\r\nVoici donc une livrée pour l'A-19 Brawler inspirée de celle portée par les Rafale de l'escadron de chasse 1/7 \"Provence\" de l'armée de l'air et de l'espace. Cet escadron est particulier car il est basé à l'étranger, sur la base aérienne 104 d'Al Dhafra aux Emirats Arabes Unis, depuis 2016. Les Rafales de cet escadron sont particulièrement actifs dans la lutte air-sol contre Daesh en Irak comme en Syrie. Et ces actions de combat semblent cohérentes avec les missions du A-19 Brawler.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nAlright, this time I have yet to find an aiframe fielded by France that would ressemble either the A-19 or the A-10 it is inspired by. But still, the A-19 is particularly useful in game and so it deserves its French based livery. Furthermore, such a livery is eagerly awaited by some with whom I play ;)\r\n\r\nSo here is a livery for the A-19 Brawler inspired by the one sported by the Rafales of Fighter Squadron 1/7 \"Provence\" of the French Air and Space Force. This squadron is unique in that it is garrisoned overseas at Airbase 104 in Al Dhfra in the United Arab Emirates since 2016. The squadron's Rafale are particularly active in striking the forces of ISIS in Iraq or Syria. And this combat history seems to match the missions of the A-19 Brawler.\r",

Même le numéro de modèle semble y faire référence... Et le Caiman est en service dans l'armée de terre et dans la marine nationale. Or je n'ai pas encore réalisé de livrée pour cette aéronef pour représenter nos amis les marins.\r\n\r\nAlors voici donc une livrée pour l'UH-90 Ibis inspirée des Caïmans Marine (la version française du NH-90 dans sa variante NFH, [i]NATO Frigate Helicopter[/i]) de la flottille 31F de la marine nationale.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nAlright, the coaxial rotors and the pusher impellers notwithstanding, the new UH-90 Ibis does bear some ressemblance to the NH-90, doesn't it? Even the model numbers seems to be a reference to it as well... And the NH-90 happens to be fielded by both the French Army and French Navy. And I have yet to make a livery for this airframe that represents our sailors.\r\n\r\nThus here is a livery for the UH-90 Ibis inspired by the NH-90 Caïman Marine (the French version of the NFH, NATO Frigate Helicopter, variant of the NH-90) of flotilla 3F of the French Navy.",

    "description": "La version 0.31 nous a apporté un hélicoptère de manoeuvre, enfin sa vision du futur d'un hélicoptère de manoeuvre : l'UH-90 Ibis. Et avec cet appareil a été ajouté la fonctionnalité de sauvetage au combat par hélitreuillage. L'armée de l'air et de l'espace a justement un escadron dont la mission principale est justement le sauvetage : l'escadron d'hélicoptère 1/67 \"Pyrénées\". Le sauvetage guide la vie de cette unité : sauvetage au combat de pilotes éjectés notamment ou de blessés en opérations extérieures, mais aussi recherche et sauvetage en mer et à terre sur le territoire national en renfort des moyens du ministère de l'Intérieur, voire à la place quant les conditions ne permettent pas à leurs aéronefs de construction civile de décoller. Un escadron dont les compétences ont été reconnues au plus haut niveau qui a rejoint le commandement des opérations spéciales en 2014 et qui fête ses 50 ans en cette année 2025.\r\n\r\nEt voici donc une livrée pour l'UH-90 Ibis inspirée de celles portées par les Caracal de cet escadron prestigieux pour \"combattre et sauver\" comme le veut sa devise.\r\n\r\nERREUR CONNUE : En configuration avec des mitrailleurs de sabord, la texture du sabord droit est inversée, c'est dû à une erreur dans le modèle 3D en lui même et n'est pas corrigeable à mon niveau.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nVersion 0.31 brought us a transport helicopter, or rather the game's vision of a future transport helicopter : the UH-90 Ibis. And with this airframe was also added the ability to rescue pilots with a winch. The French Air and Space Force actually has a specialized squadron whose main mission is search and rescue : helicopter squadron 1/67 \"Pyrénées\". This mission drives the unit, be it combat search and rescue of downed pilots or of casualties during deployments, but also maritime and ground search and rescue on French soil in assistance of assets from the Ministry of the Interior or even in stead of when conditions force its civilian made airframes on the ground. A squadron whose skills have been recognized at the highest level and that has been made a part of France's Special Operations Command in 2014, and which is celebrating in 2025 50 years since its creation.\r\n\r\nAnd so here is a livery for the UH-90 Ibis inspired by the ones seen on the Caracal of this prestigious squadron so as to \"fight and rescue\" as its motto states.\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUE : When equipped with door gunners, the starboard side gunner hatch texture is mirrored. This is due to an error in the 3D model itself that I cannot fix.",

    "description": "A revamped version of the Single Player mission, \"Bridge Defense\". Now with CO-OP in mind! This variant of said mission, features far more enemies and restrictions for player aircraft. Only low tier aircraft and the Tarantula are allowed to be flown.\r\n\r\nWhile you're outnumbered for the most part, you can capture a couple of Neutral Airbases to spawn factories to provide more allied aircraft to your side. Both BONUS airbases also have their own additional BONUS objective that will be activated a few minutes from their respective capture, to reward additional allies to join the fight.\r\n\r\n[UPDATE 1.1]\r\n\r\n-Allied Radar SAMs will be brought online shortly after 10 mins, to help counter the 1st wave of enemy Revokers. They will be quite helpful at keeping the enemy at bay.\r\n\r\n-A small squadron of allied Vortex's will spawn to help draw attack the 2nd wave of enemy aircraft.\r\n\r\n-Allied Shard Corvettes have been moved slightly North to avoid being sunk the the BONUS Destroyer near Agrapol Airbase.\r\n\r\n-When the Agrapol Capture phase begins, additional Vehicle Depots will spawn at the destroyed enemy Depot objective. This will help promote the usage of Ground Force donations to keep the pressure on. Allied AA will spawn here too.\r\n\r\n-An additional Helipad has been added for the F.O.B. BONUS objective. Will also spawn additional Laser CWIS to improve survivability of the F.O.B.\r\n\r\n-Speaking of the Laser CWIS at the updated F.O.B., this will indirectly make the Air base assault easier. Will help intercept enemy fire.",

We believe that this may be the signature of a prototype PALA EW station, and the goal of this mission will be to destroy its emitter, which doubles as its database.\n\nHowever, we are unaware of its exact location. The only thing we were able to extrapolate was a very large approximate range where the source could be, which is in the Primevan homeland.\n\nIntercepted radio communications suggest that several PALA airbases are either currently getting resupplied with munitions and aircraft parts, or getting runways and taxiways resurfaced.

Ici on est dans la pure fiction, mais ça ne reste pas moins drôle de voir un hélicoptère d'attaque portant les couleurs de la Maréchaussée :D\r\n\r\nVoilà donc une livrée pour le Chicane très librement inspirée de celles des H160 et EC-145 des forces aériennes de la Gendarmerie nationale.\r\n\r\nSi vous voulez une livrée française réaliste pour le Chicane je ne peux que vivement vous conseiller [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3296258427]celle faite par Dubeard[/url].\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\n[quote=\"French Defense Code, art.

Here we are in pure fiction, but it still is very funny to me to see and attack helicopter sporting the colors of the Maréchaussée :D\r\n\r\nSo here is a livery for the Chicane that is very loosely based on those seen on H160 and EC-145 helicopters of the French Gendarmerie Air Forces.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a realistic French livery for the Chicane however, I can vouch for [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3296258427]Dubeard's[/url].",

En plissant, très fort, des yeux ça pourrait vaguement faire un Fouga Magister. Et ça tombe bien, j'avais pas de livrée pour m'entrainer à apponter dans Nuclear Option.\r\n\r\nVoilà donc une livrée pour le Compass inspirée des Fouga Zéphyr, la version navalisée du Fouga Magister, de la flottille 59S de la Marine Nationale. La flottille 59S est actuellement inactive puisque officiellement dissoute en 1997. Elle avait à charge la qualification à l'appontage des futurs pilotes embarqués de l'aéronavale et était dotée de Zéphyr, d'Etendard IV puis de Super-Etendard. Les pilotes français sont aujourd'hui formés et qualifiés aux États-Unis par l'US Navy sur T-45 Goshawk.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nThe Compass, a twin engine, two seater, subsonic, training aircraft and particularly a carrier recovery training aircraft, with a V tail (and elevators ok, hush). If you squint a little, okay maybe a lot, you could vaguely mistake it for a Fouga Magister. And that is good enough for me since I needed a livery to go with my own carrier recovery training in Nuclear Option.\r\n\r\nSo here is a livery for the Compass inspired by the Fouga Zéphyr, the navalized variant of the Fouga Magister, of flotilla 59S of the French Navy. The flotilla currently stands inactive as it was officially dissolved in 1997. The flotilla was responsible for the training and qualification flights of pilots of French Navy's Air Arm in regards to carrier recovery operations. It was equipped with Zéphyr, Etendard IV and later Super-Etendard. French navy pilots are now training and qualified in the United States by the US Navy on T-45 Goshawk.",

Inspired by the classic version of Carrier Duel and Terminal Control, this mission is heavily built around fast paced combat, suitable for usage on any regular multiplayer server.\r\n\r\nAs with most, if not all Spring in Boscali missions, Naval Skirmish can be described as somewhat of a demonstration of what's possible when pushing the mission editor to its absolute limits. Naval Skirmish features a realistic depiction of a passing tropical cyclone, albeit heavily sped up, including cloud formations and wind shifts, including their reversal on the other side of the cyclone.\r\n\r\nIntended Play Order:\r\nNaval Skirmish > Breakthrough > Primevan Spring > Vanguard > Dawn (currently unreleased) > Dusk (currently unreleased) > Counterforce (currently unreleased) > Inferno (currently unreleased) > Midnight (currently unreleased)\r\n\r\n\r\n[h2] Known Issues [/h2]\r\n\r\nThe mission can become laggy towards the midgame, especially when the destroyers fire their ASHMs. Not much I can do about this as this is mainly a game optimization issue. (Update: I believe I've made it so that the destroyers now stagger their ASHM fire, but this comes at the cost of AI skill. Please let me know if some of the destroyers behave oddly due to this change, or if some are now too weak.)\r\n\r\nWeather transitions could stand to be more smooth and less abrupt, but again, this is more of a game issue and isn't something I can solve.\r\n\r\nFollowing updates to the suburbs around Feldspar, some of the bases in the mission may have clipping with buildings and otherwise look off. That said, in theory, the mission should be fully functional and playable, aesthetic issues aside.\n\n[h2] Extras [/h2]\r\n\r\n[url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/18c6C56NBTInMfV5nf-9H_NV4UNnDrPAIqkBx282Xi_U/edit?usp=sharing] Spring in Boscali Lore Document [/url] \r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3503215059] Spring in Boscali Collection [/url]",

    "description": "Step out of the simulator and take part in a civil war between a corrupt constitutional monarchy and an armed left wing rebellion to decide the future of Primeva.\r\n\r\nThe third mission in the Spring in Boscali series, and the last mission before the mainline trilogy is released. Based around high speed and high rank air, naval, and land combat across most of Ignus, Primevan Spring aims to combine story with enjoyable gameplay, while simultaneously improving on the concepts tested in Naval Skirmish, Breakthrough, and Vanguard. In total, around 10-20 hours of gameplay is available in this one mission, split between each of the 6 endings.\r\n\r\nIn development since March (9 months ago, at the time of release), Primevan Spring is to my knowledge the most ambitious Nuclear Option mission ever created. Combining the logic systems tested in Breakthrough with all of my experience making enjoyable gameplay over the years, Primevan Spring started as a quick prequel to the mainline SiB trilogy, and has since evolved into the culmination of everything I know about the editor to date. For most of those 9 months, the mission was physically impossible to be finished, and only recently after directly coordinating with Shockfront Studios has the game been updated to make a core feature of the mission technically feasible. With that said, after all this time, I sincerely hope you enjoy. It's been long enough.\r\n\r\nIntended Play Order:\r\nNaval Skirmish > Breakthrough > Primevan Spring > Vanguard > Dawn (currently unreleased) > Dusk (currently unreleased) > Counterforce (currently unreleased) > Inferno (currently unreleased) > Midnight (currently unreleased)\r\n\r\n[h2] Known Issues [/h2]\r\n\r\nWith the unparalleled scale of the mission and the limited size and tight schedule of the Spring in Boscali development team, I would imagine that there are still many issues throughout the mission at the time of release. Because of this, I'm going to need the help of those playing the mission to report the issues they find so I can fix them.\r\n\r\nThe match can very easily turn into a slog for PALA when losing since the win condition is based on capturing instead of destroying all of their hangars, I'll see if I can work something out soon akin to the fast capture system in Breakthrough, but it'd need to be tested first and that could take some time given the complexity of the mission. Update: I tested this, but due to a fundamental bug with the way the game handles airbase buildings used in objectives I physically cannot fix this until Shockfront fixes the aforementioned bug.\r\n\r\nFollowing updates to the suburbs around Feldspar, some of the bases in the mission may have clipping with buildings and otherwise look off. That said, in theory, the mission should be fully functional and playable, aesthetic issues aside.\r\n\r\n[h2] Extras [/h2]\r\n\r\n[url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/18c6C56NBTInMfV5nf-9H_NV4UNnDrPAIqkBx282Xi_U/edit?usp=sharing] Spring in Boscali Lore Document [/url] \r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3503215059] Spring in Boscali Collection [/url]\r\n\r\n[h2] Credits [/h2]\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/aptrpl6] Olivefox[/url]: Mission Development\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198328703399/] Droopy_[/url]: Thumbnail, Playtesting\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198247783232/] Javiairplane[/url]: Liveries, Playtesting\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198212591527/] Phoenix1509[/url]: Liveries, Playtesting\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199588512045/] Snowyyy[/url]: Playtesting\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ivusm] AlexOrSmthIdk[/url]: Playtesting\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/squeegymackoy] SqueegyMackoy[/url]: Technical Assistance, Bug fixing with the game as a whole\r\n\r\nAnd others (It's been so long that I truly can't remember who all was involved with this project, please let me know if you were involved and I'll add you to the credits, thank you all for helping me get this project out the door.)",

PALA doesn't care how much it'll cost, just sink their fleet!\r\n\r\nNukes are enabled and PALA has a massive nuclear stockpile, as well.\r\n\r\nThis mission is DIFFICULT and will take over an hour to complete. It took me roughly an hour by myself. I suggest having friends assist.\r\n\r\nFair warning: You will need a decent PC to play this mission in it's entirety. As the fleets approach, they will fire ballistic missiles at one another. In response the other ships will launch missiles to intercept, and use their CRAMS. All of this creates lag from the entities. I never dropped below 50 frames, but I expect a massive performance dip on lower end PCs.   ",

    "description": "The only thing similar to this i've ever made was custom maps on the older Far Cry games and making this gave me some nostalgia from those times. A revamped version of the original, V2 features an asymmetrical take on the islands where the BDF is on the defensive and PALA on offense. BDF has boosted ground production as well as upgraded ground and AA defenses which are in a somewhat layered style. BDF has 6 additional corvettes that come into the fight but require time to get operational. The BDF have also built on the small island north of the bridge naming it Bridgeguard Island. Here there is a small heliport, ammo and fuel factories, radar, and most importantly a dock for ships to periodically resupply at. PALA has a much smaller boost to their production, but their primary  advantage is a huge initial wave of aircraft, as well as the ability to sustain large numbers of aircraft in the sky at all times. Since the BDF have taken a defensive approach to the incoming battle PALA is in a much better position to grab Feldspar first, another massive advantage that compounds with their already massive air capability.",

Now having split the Heartlands down the middle following their initial offensives both sides scramble to retake lost territories and hold new conquests. \r\n\r\nJoin either the BDF or PALA and help strike the final decisive blow to finally end this disastrous war.\r\n\r\nMission Time: Roughly 1-2 hours solo depending on skill level and likely an hour in co-op although time could easily vary\r\n\r\n-Carriers spawn at 30m as well as two large convoys to help both sides\r\n\r\n-Nuclear Piledrivers(20kt) have been restricted due to critically low supply and are only to be used by any remaining ground based launchers. \r\n\r\nAdditional tips and notes: \r\n-Due to losses of critical infrastructure both sides can only produce 1 Darkreach every 30 minutes so use them wisely.\r\n\r\n-As the PALA your top priority should be taking out Sandrift as it will prevent you from moving deeper into BDF territory. \r\n\r\n-The BDF will send a large ground force with Heli support to try and take back North Boscali. You can try and help them as the BDF or attempt to stop them as the PALA.\r\n\r\n-Supplying your ships can give you a notable advantage over the enemy especially the BDF as if the navy can help wipe out Vigil Cay.\r\n\r\n-For single player tweak the Reserve settings to have both factions keep one Aircraft in reserve for a more balanced experience.\r\n\r\n-This is a large mission so do let me know if you spot any glitches or balance issues cause there's always a chance I overlooked something during testing.",

    "description": "Alors finalement si, l'Armée de l'air et de l'espace a bien un aéronef qui ressemble de très TRES loin au A-19 : l'ALSR \"VADOR\" ou avion léger de surveillance et de reconnaissance \"vecteur aéroporté de désignation, d'observation et de reconnaissance\" qui est basé sur la cellule d'un Beechcraft King Air 350 civil. Oui les missions n'ont rien à voir, le A-19 est un avion d'attaque au sol et l'ALSR un avion de reconnaissance mais surtout de renseignement électronique. Mais bon, pourquoi pas ?\r\n\r\nEt donc voici une livrée pour le A-19 Brawler librement inspirée des ALSR \"VADOR\" de l'escadron de reconnaissance 4/33 Périgord de l'armée de l'air et de l'espace et qui les met en oeuvre depuis la base aérienne 709 Cognac-Châteaubernard.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nIn the end the French Air and Space Force does field an aircraft that very VERY vaguely ressembles the A-19, if you squint really hard : the [i]ALSR \"VADOR\"[/i], the light surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft \"airborne designation, observation and reconnaissance asset\" which is based on the civilian Beechcraft King Air 350 airframe. And sure, the A-19's missions have nothing in common with the [i]ALSR \"VADOR\"[/i], the former being a ground attack and close air support aircraft whilst the latter is a reconnaissance and more importantly ELINT aircraft. But who cares?\r\n\r\nAnd so here is a livery for the A-19 Brawler loosely inspired by the [i]ALSR \"VADOR\"[/i] of 4/33 \"Périgord\" reconnaissance squadron of the French Air and Space Force operating out of 709 Cognac-Châteaubernard Air Force Base.",

    "description": "This is my personal Escalation mission I play most of the time. A lot of misc ground units have been removed, mostly LCVs, Fuel Trucks, and APCs that don't serve much use. Most aircraft loadouts have been trimmed down to be approximately equal to an equivalent aircraft in the 1990s. To compensate for the reduced spam, air defenses have also had their skill levels reduced. Factories producing most ground units have had their building times increased to reduce the number of ground units clobbering your computer's resources. Tanks make up a larger portion of the ground units now. An APC factory on each side has been replaced with a CEV (Jackknife) factory.\r\n\r\nThere are a few small map changes: BDF has a small FARP in the mountains, and both sides have a small stockpile of Stratolance launchers, CIWS, and LASER defenses that a Tarantula can carry to build new SAM sites.\r\n\r\nThe Stratolance sites have been downgraded by removing the Fire Control vehicles, and one specific Anvil has been nerfed to be an AFV6-AA.\r\n\r\nNotable weapons restricted:\r\nDouble and Triple Scimitar racks (all)\r\nDouble and Triple Scythe racks (external)\r\nDouble AGM-68 racks (external)\r\nTriple AGM-48 racks\r\nQuad, Triple IRM-S2 racks (all)\r\nTriple Kingpin racks\r\nTuskos (all)\r\nAFV6 IFV, APC variants (To make AI Tarantula Flights a bit less useless)",

Alors pourquoi pas le représenter ?\r\n\r\nJe propose donc ici une livrée pour le SFB-81 Darkreach inspirée librement des livrées bariolées des Mirage IV P de l'escadron de bombardement 2/91 \"Bretagne\" qui était basé sur la base aérienne de Cazaux jusqu'à la dissolution de l'escadron en 1993.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nEven though France does not field a dedicated strategic bomber anymore, it used to be the case a few decades ago. Sure, the Mirage IV was not as imposing as the SFB-81 but it was still a large airframe. So, let's honor it in game !\r\n\r\nAnd thus here is a livery for the SFB-81 Darkreach inspired by the camoflaged liveries of the Mirage IV P of the French Air Force's bomber squadron 2/91 \"Bretagne\", which operated out of Cazaux Air Force Base until it was dissolved in 1993.",

    "description": "Si la France n'a plus aujourd'hui de bombardier stratégique dédié ce n'était pas le cas il y a quelques décennies. Certes nous n'étions pas sur les mêmes dimensions que le SFB-81 mais le Mirage IV était quand même un beau bébé. Alors pourquoi pas le représenter ? \r\n\r\nJe propose donc ici une livrée pour le SFB-81 Darkreach inspirée librement des livrées gris aluminium des Mirage IV A du centre d'instruction des forces aériennes stratégiques 328 \"Aquitaine\" qui était basé sur la base aérienne de Mérignac jusqu'à sa dissolution en 1991. Ici est plus spécifiquement representé le Mirage IV A n° 9 arborant la coupe FANTASIA (compétition annuelle interne des FAS) qu'il avait gagné en 1967.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nEven though France does not field a dedicated strategic bomber anymore, it used to be the case a few decades ago. Sure, the Mirage IV was not as imposing as the SFB-81 but it was still a large airframe. So, let's honor it in game !\r\n\r\nAnd thus here is a livery for the SFB-81 Darkreach inspired by the bare metal aluminum gray liveries of the Mirage IV A of the French Air Force's Strategic Air Forces Training Center 328 \"Aquitaine\", which operated out of Mérignac Air Force Base until it was dissolved in 1991. The airframe represented here is more specifically Mirage IV A n° 9 seen sporting the FANTASIA cup (a yearly tournament between French nuclear squadrons) it won in 1967.",

    "description": "Je sais que le FS-20 Vortex est très largement inspiré du Boeing X-32, mais avec son entrée d'air toute particulière et son nez il a un profil qui me rappelle malgré tout un peu le F-8 Crusader. Une version modernisée et rendue \"furtive\" du Crusader certes, mais quand même. C'est d'autant plus vrai je trouve quand il est en configuration lisse, que j'utilise beaucoup personnellement pour exploiter au maximum la grande furtivité du Vortex. Cette configuration lui donne un profil assez ressemblant et elle est cohérente avec le titre \"[i]The Last of the Gunfighters[/i]\" qui avait été donné au Crusader.\r\n\r\nLe Crusader a été employé dans la marine nationale et étaient embarqués sur porte-avion. Il se trouve d'ailleurs que la France fut le dernier opérateur du F-8 Crusader, les derniers appareils se posant pour la dernière fois en 1999. Vous trouverez donc ici une livrée pour le FS-20 Vortex inspiré de la livrée portée par les F-8 Crusader de la désormais dissoute flottille 14F de la marine nationale.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nI know that the FS-20 Vortex is largely inspired by the Boeing X-32, but with its very peculiar ar intake and its nose it has a side view that reminds me somewhat of the F-8 Crusader. A modernized and stealthier version of the Crusader sure, but still. And I find it even more obvious when it is in a slick configuration, which I personally use quite a lot to fully exploit the Vortex' minimal RCS. In this configuration it ressembles and looks the part for the fighter aircraft that was known as \"The last of the Gunfighters\" in its time.\r\n\r\nThe F-8 Crusader was used by the French Navy and deployed on French aircraft carriers of the time. And it also happens that France was the Crusader's last operator, the last flying airframes making their final landings in 1999. You will find here then a livery for the FS-20 Vortex inspired by the liveries seen on the F-8 Crusader of the now disbanded flotilla 14F of the French Navy.",

Il se trouve qu'une autre armée en mets aussi en oeuvre, et très certainement d'une façon bien plus offensive que les aviateurs. Il s'agit de l'armée de terre qui en emploie au sein du 4e régiment d'helicoptère de forces spéciales. Ainsi l'un de ces escadrilles est dotée de Caracal pour le dépôt de commandos. Les livrées de l'EH 1/67 et de l'escadrille de Caracal du 4e RHFS étant très proches, il serait idiot pour moi de ne pas en profiter ;)\r\n\r\nVoici donc une livrée pour l'UH-90 Ibis inspirée des Caracal en service au sein du 4e RHFS de l'armée de terre. Ceux-ci devraient d'ailleurs être reversés à l'armée de l'air et de l'espace au fur et à mesure de la réception de nouveau NH-90 spécialement conçus pour les missions spéciales du 4e RHFS.\r\n\r\nERREUR CONNUE : En configuration avec des mitrailleurs de sabord, la texture du sabord droit est inversée, c'est dû à une erreur dans le modèle 3D en lui même et n'est pas corrigeable à mon niveau.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nRecently I released [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3603963329]a livery inspired by the Caracal helicopters of the French Air and Space Force[/url]. However there actually is another branch of the French military that fields Caracals, and one that does so probably much more aggressively than the airmen. Indeed, the French Army's 4th Special Forces Helicopter Regiment has one of its flights fielding Caracals to transport and deploy commandos. The liveries of 1/67 Helicopter Squadron and of 4th Special Forces Helicopter Regiment being very similar, it would be a shame not to profit from it ;)\r\n\r\nAnd so here is a livery for the UH-90 Ibis inspired by the Caracals serving in the French Army's 4th Special Forces Helicopter Regiment. Airframes that should slowly be transferred to the French Air and Space Force as the Regiment begins fielding new NH-90 helicopters specially made for special operations.\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUE : When equipped with door gunners, the starboard side gunner hatch texture is mirrored. This is due to an error in the 3D model itself that I cannot fix.",

Or l'armée de l'air et de l'espace en met en oeuvre 4 (dans leur version E-3F) au sein du 36e escadron de détection et de contrôle aéroportés \"Berry\". Après avoir mis à l'honneur la [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3471603661]composante aéronavale française de la mission de guêt aérien[/url], pourquoi ne pas en faire de même pour celle opérant depuis les terres.\r\n\r\nVoici donc une livrée pour l'EW-25 Medusa inspirée d'un des appareils du 36e EDCA, plus spécifiquement de celui reprenant les traditions de l'ecadrille SAL 253 \"Tête de Bouledogue\".\r\n\r\nNOTE : A ma connaissance il n'est pas (encore ?) possible de texturer le radôme comme on le souhaite. Je n'ai donc malheureusement pas pu y placer la bande blanche bien connue sur le radome noir.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nAlright, I know that the Medusa is supposed to be a carrier capable VTOL aircraft, but with its rotating radome it is hard not to see some ressemblance with the larger E-3 Sentry AWACS aircrafts. The French Air and Space Force operates 4 of those (the E-3F variant) in the 36th Airborne Detection and Control Squadron \"Berry\". After having showcased [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3471603661]France's carrier based airborne early warning capability[/url], why not do the same for its ground based one?\r\n\r\nThusly here is a livery for the EW-25 Medusa inspired by one of the aircraft of 36th EDCA, specifically the one harboring the traditions of Flight SAL 253 \"Tête de Bouledogue\".\r\n\r\nNOTE : To my knowledge it is not (yet?) possible to texture at will the rotating radome.

Ainsi les 14 avions de guêt aérien avancé E-3 Sentry de la Force aéroportée de détection lointaine et de contrôle de l'OTAN sont immatriculés au Luxembourg par exemple. Et donc ainsi, le Luxembourg apporte l'une des capacités majeures de l'OTAN pour le combat aérien, celle de commandement et de contrôle du champ de bataille depuis les airs.\r\n\r\nJe vous propose donc ici une livrée pour l'EW-25 Medusa inspirée de celle classiquement portée par ces avions AWACS de l'OTAN.\r\n\r\nNOTE : A ma connaissance il n'est pas (encore ?) possible de texturer le radôme comme on le souhaite.

And its size can be quite surprising when compared to its ground component. Indeed the 14 E-3 Sentry Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft of NATO's Airborne Early Warning and Control Force are registered in Luxembourg. Thusly this small nation ends up providing one of NATO's major support ability for air combat : airborne battlefield command and control.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I am offering here a livery for the EW-25 Medusa inspired by those seen on NATO's AWACS aircrafts.\r\n\r\nNOTE : To my knowledge it is not (yet?) possible to texture at will the rotating radome.

Fearing that they would not be able to hide forever, the leaders of the Primevan Guard executed a full-scale retreat operation from Heartland. It began with small convoys, disguised as civilian goods transports, moving their assets out. Their bases were destroyed afterwards to avoid leaving any evidence of their presence. Most assets had already been moved abroad, and the only thing remaining was the most challenging one: a disassembled nuclear bomb. That was loaded onto waste disposal truck with other radioactive junk.\r\n\r\n\"Our operations in this region are in danger, after some of our fellow rebels groups were compomised we are afraid that our time will soon come, thats why we have decided to move our base of operation on the Ignus, to the heart of BDF.\"\r\n\r\nShort mission where player task is to safely escort a High Value trucks that contain components and pieces of nuclear bomb to the docks.",

    "description": "Launch a surprise attack against Boscali from aboard a Primevan carrier sent to clear the way for a coming invasion force, while facing off against increasing numbers of BDF aircraft as time progresses.\r\n\r\nFocusing on team communication, coordination, and airframe preservation, Vanguard seeks to create an enjoyable experience for those wishing to have an in-depth coordinated mission in Nuclear Option. \r\n\r\nChronologically the 4th mission in the Spring in Boscali series, Vanguard has been released out of its intended order (3rd mission instead of 4th, at the time of writing) while I wait for Primevan Spring to be released when 0.31 is finished. If you want to play the series in its true intended order, it might be best to wait until that mission is out before trying this one. But for those who have asked me for more SiB content and wondering when the next mission is coming (you know who you are!), you might enjoy getting a peek at what's to come for the series.\r\n\r\nFrom this point on, I'm going to be including the intended play order of each mission here on the workshop (and maybe in the in-game descriptions too if people still end up asking me about it), and I'll be going back and doing this for each of my previous missions. At the time of writing, most of these are unreleased, but expect to see them at some point in the future. These missions are big, lengthy projects that I do on my free time, so it'll definitely be a while before the series is finished.\r\n\r\nIntended Play Order:\r\nNaval Skirmish > Breakthrough > Primevan Spring > Vanguard > Dawn (currently unreleased) > Dusk (currently unreleased) > Counterforce (currently unreleased) > Inferno (currently unreleased) > Midnight (currently unreleased)\r\n\r\n[h2] Known Issues [/h2]\r\n\r\nWeather transitions are, again, not very smooth, but this is a game issue and not something I can solve at the moment.\r\n\r\nShip pathfinding can be... Questionable, but this is another game issue that will hopefully be fixed in 0.31. Expect your ships to possibly disregard orders and/or beach themselves.\r\n\r\n[h2] Extras [/h2]\r\n\r\n[url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/18c6C56NBTInMfV5nf-9H_NV4UNnDrPAIqkBx282Xi_U/edit?usp=sharing] Spring in Boscali Lore Document [/url] \r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3503215059] Spring in Boscali Collection [/url]",

Ici on est dans la pure fiction, mais ça ne reste pas moins drôle de voir un hélicoptère d'attaque portant les couleurs de la Maréchaussée :D\r\n\r\nVoilà donc une livrée pour le Chicane très librement inspirée de la livrée \"en négatif\" du premier exemplaire du H160 Pégase livré à la DGA et à la Gendarmerie nationale pour les essais en vol.\r\n\r\nSi vous voulez une livrée française réaliste pour le Chicane je ne peux que vivement vous conseiller [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3296258427]celle faite par Dubeard[/url].\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\n[quote=French Defense Code, art. R3225-6 § 7]All of the French Gendarmerie commands are intended to assist in the defense of the territory.[/quote]\r\n\r\nAlright, I will admit that this livery completely goes against the more grounded in realism, or at least based on actual aircraft ressembling those of Nuclear Option, liveries that I have made before. Here we are in pure fiction, but it still is very funny to me to see and attack helicopter sporting the colors of the Maréchaussée :D\r\n\r\nSo here is a livery for the Chicane that is very loosely based on the \"inverted colors\" livery seen on the very first H160 Pégase delivered to the French Directorate General of Armaments and to the French Gendarmerie for flight tests.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a realistic French livery for the Chicane however, I can vouch for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3296258427]Dubeard's[/url].",

    "description": "Cette livrée nécessite je pense un petit peu de contexte. Après avoir fait, dans l'ordre, le Compass, le Revoker, le Medusa, je voulais réaliser une livrée française pour le Cricket. D'autant plus que c'est souvent le premier avion disponible dans la partie pour les joueurs, et que je l'apprécie fortement pour ce qu'il est, un petit avion d'observation et de contre-insurrection. Mais voilà, je base mes travaux sur des avions existants ou ayant existé dans l'arsenal français, et là comme ça, rien ne me venait. Les Skyraiders utilisés en Algérie notamment ne ressemblent pas du tout au Cricket par exemple. Et la France n'a jamais utilisé d'OV-10 Bronco, source claire d'inspiration pour le Cricket. Et puis mes recherches m'ont fait découvrir le Potez 75.\r\n\r\nBiplace, destiné à l'origine à des missions anti-chars, d'observation et de \"maintien de l'ordre\" (comprendre \"contre-insurrection\" en langage de l'époque), avec une double queue, une gouverne de profondeur en position haute et une unique hélice propulsive. Un unique exemplaire a été produit, au frais du constructeur Potez et prété à l'aviation légère de l'Armée de Terre pour subir une batterie de tests par les armées de Terre et de l'Air. Voilà donc de quoi m'inspirer !\r\n\r\nVous trouverez donc ici une livrée inspirée de l'unique Potez 75 ici pendant ses tests au Centre d'Essai en Vol avec l'immatriculation civile F-ZWSA.\r\n\r\nENGLISH VERSION BELOW / VERSION EN LANGUE ANGLAISE CI-DESSOUS\r\n\r\nThis particular livery might require some bits of context. After having made liveries for the Compass, the Revoker, and the Medusa, I wanted to make a French livery for the Cricket. This was especially the case as it often is the first aircraft made available to players in games, and as I quite like the plane for what it is : a small observation and couter-insurgency platform. However, I base my work on actual aircrafts used at some point by France, and here nothing was coming to mind. The Skyariders used in Algeria do not ressemble the Cricket in any way for example. And France never used OV-10 Broncos, clearly the primary source of inspiration for the Cricket. But then, my research  made me discover the Potez 75.\r\n\r\nA two-seater aircraft, intended for anti-tank, observation and counter-insurgency duties, with a twin tail, which included a raised elevator connecting it, and a push propeller. A single unit was built, on Potez company funds and it was loaned to the French Army light aviation for testing by the French Army and Air Force. This was the source of inspiration I was looking for !\r\n\r\nThusly, here is a livery for the Cricket inspired by the only Potez 75 built, here sporting the livery used whilst conducting flight tests at France's Flight Test Center with its civilian tail number F-ZWSA.\r",

Foreign peacekeeping forces, prioritizing continental homeland security, have withdrawn, leaving a power vacuum over these strategic islands.\r\n\r\nSecuring nuclear stockpiles is the priority. They are located on the four outermost islands. Use the available fleet to move towards the points of interest. Use Tarantulas to gain control over airbases and oil rigs quicker.\r\n\r\nRemember, there are no active radars on the islands. You are operating in the dark and so is the enemy. You've been given a cash boost, but our assets are limited and we can't afford to waste any airframes or vessels provided. However, we are willing to reward you for your hard work.

Kapitan Danilkin faces a difficult task: to take command of the 228th special motorized rifle brigade led by Agent Smith, land troops on the Fecal Archipelago, track down Admiral Chan, capture the target and break any resistance. For both sides, this battle will be decisive, this is Admiral Chan's last chance to fight back, gain a foothold and then launch a counterattack, and for Danilkin, the opportunity to end this war means returning to the gut-shaking beer passions on the Donetsk River and the great solstice on the Ugra motor block.

    "description": "Firebase Gazpacho has been under heavy attack following the PALA's cowardly Arbor Day offensive. Our guys are running out of armored vehicles to defend their position with. Boscali forces are stretched thin- your Brawler wing is all we can deploy to buy time until reinforcements can get to Gazpacho. Their ETA is 30-45 minutes so the few of you have got to delay the enemy ground forces at any cost. The firebase commands vital supplylines that control the whole Eastern region. It must not fall into PALA hands. And don't bother trying to take out wherever the enemy ground units are coming from, air defenses are far too dense. Expect heavy enemy pushes from both the North and South, but we do not expect any enemy air in the AO. Scramble quickly and buy our boys down at Gazpacho some time!\n\nWIP   3-6 Player PVE ~45 minutes ",

The Boscali's had recently scaled back military presence, and had diplomatically hoped for peace between the two nations.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the resources that Boscali territory sit on is too valuable for the Primevans to ignore. The BDF were unable to hold out long, and were forced to retreat and evacuate to the Ignus Archipelago.\r\n\r\nAs the shock settles, the Boscali people are filled with an absolute resolve and woken to a reality of danger. Ships and assets set for decomission are put back into service, factories are put into wartime production, defensive positions are set and the Boscali are now prepared more than ever to fight for the sovereignty of their nation. The BDF now have a task of enduring the large invasion force the Primevans have sent towards the eastern isles, and then push them out before they have time to properly dig in and complete the invasion, sending them onto the backfoot, facilitating a counterattack to recapture the Heartlands.\r\n\r\nMission in summary is take off from either feldspar or forward operating base, cap opal, ashwood aux, destroy fleets, etc etc.\r\n\r\nVery heavy work in progress, any advice, suggestions, bugs, let me know, thank you.",

Each side has one main airbase and one forward airbase, with naval assets watching the flanks, additional naval assets will arrive after 25 minuets. Adjust the active AI aircraft to increase or decrease the difficulty. I made this so I could have a more challenging single player experience without having to play a full game of escalation.",

    "description": "This is the 1 life edit for the mission. I have taken away nuclear piledrivers (and respawns) due to their uncanny ability to ruin the game (and due to the AI just slinging them everywhere driving the stockpile down). \r\n\r\nAn enormous, high intensity war of attrition with all airbases active and using all available assets.\r\n\r\nSuccessively more powerful aircraft, and eventually thermonuclear weapons, are unlocked by increasing individual and team point score respectively. The goal of this mission is to try and beat the mission with only one life. You are able to land and leave your aircraft, but don’t crash or eject behind enemy lines. Other than that, it is same vanilla mission. \r\n\r\nVictory is achieved when all enemy aircraft factories are destroyed and the enemy side's aircraft carrier, which will arrive midway through the battle, is sunk.\r\n\r\n\rCredit to \r              \"Klawifiantix\" for the video \"Nuclear Option - One Life Challenge\" for this mission idea.",

    "description": "The complete occupation and control of the Ignus Archipelago is high priority for both the PALA, and the BDF. The BDF have been aggressively funding airbase and defense platform construction in the area to both secure their claims and ease logistical burdens. During a period of significantly heightened tensions amid an ongoing ceasefire, a PALA VL-49 transport was shot down by a BDF pilot who mis-identified the craft as past the much disputed control line for the archipelago, resulting in all out warfare across the island chain. \r\n\r\nThis mission is a modified variant of Terminal Control, tweaked for co-op and heavily edited in terms of additional airbases and platforms. You start at rank 3, with $150m starting funds. The platform and long-range SAM placement is favorable for the BDF, so this mission will be rather difficult without SEAD/DEAD coordination.",

    "description": "It's been more than 48 hours since the surprise attack on Bifurca Airbase. Boscali suffered a major blow from its radar station being taken out of commission. The Boscali intelligence team was able to claim wreckage of the downed bombers from the short skirmish; however no bodies have been recovered. The bombers are marked with Primevan colors further fueling tensions almost to an outright war. Civil unrest from both factions are calling for justice for the lost souls from the attack....\r\n\r\nYou've been tasked with flying Combat Air Patrol (CAP). The North West Airfield is a no fly zone and any approaching aircraft must be intercepted and forced to turn around immediately!\r\n\r\n***This is a story based mission, with a sprinkle of NATO brevity codes to give it a sense of \"realism.\" This mission is short and sweet. Aiming for those who like having a linear story, and those who want to learn NATO brevity if they decide to get into DCS.***\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is Part 3 from the aerial campaign.\r\n\r\nMission Order\r\n1) Training Day\r\n2) Payback\r\n3) Retaliation\r\n4) Eye for an Eye\r\n\r\n\r\n(I appreciate any feedback)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***PATCH NOTES***\r\nUpdated the mission to force stop objectives near the end of the mission due to not starting the objective to retreat.",

    "description": "Operation Scorched Spiral Mission Briefing:\r\n\r\nA once-mighty empire suddenly collapsed, leaving behind a vast number of unattended overseas military and industrial assets. A PALA task force arrived to investigate which of these assets were worth claiming for themselves.\r\n\r\nHowever, they were clearly not the only interested party here. And the currency for acquiring these assets was not money and time—but blood and fire.\r\n\r\nPALA has already secured a foothold in the western sector of the maritime zone during the initial landing operations and established an outpost on the western side of central Ignus Island. However, when their air force scrambled their aircraft, they quickly realized they were not alone.\r\n\r\nBDF had likewise taken control of several airbases and factories in the eastern waters, with their forward outposts pushing dangerously close to Feldspar International Airport. The clash between the two forces was imminent.\r\n\r\nThe mission would last no longer than two hours, as this was a blitzkrieg. The side that gained a foothold in the central waters first would secure aircraft production capacity and naval anti-air support—an advantage nearly impossible to overturn.\r\n\r\nThis mission is solo-player friendly. Multiplayer has not been tested, both sides receive equal support and base garrison units, so it should work technically.\r\n\r\n[Essentially Operation Storm Spire, but without the restrictions on radar-guided air-to-air missiles and long-range missiles, skipping Phase One to jump straight into the battle for the central island.]",

    "description": "Operation Regal Tide Briefing:\r\n\r\nDuring a special operation mission last night, PALA Marines silently secured Ashwood Airbase and its adjacent automated factory at the southeastern edge of the operational area, establishing air defense positions on the high ground.\r\n\r\nThe operation employed minimal naval assets to avoid detection. When BDF detected anomalies through morning communications and dispatched its 1st Carrier Strike Group southward to retake the base, PALA’s 1st Surface Action Group was forced to respond hastily.\r\n\r\nSeveral PALA naval fleets, having completed missions in other sectors, will arrive from the south in stages. However, the operation commander has decided against further delays, as satellite intelligence confirms multiple BDF fleets are also en route. Securing the central island airbase is critical for PALA to gain operational dominance in the region.\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives are:\r\n\r\nNeutralize BDF’s 1st Carrier Strike Group.\r\n\r\nAdvance north to capture Opal Airfield and Cliffline Airbase.\r\n\r\nEstablish long-range air defense coverage to enable westward island-clearing operations, ultimately expelling BDF forces from the area.\r\n\r\nPreservation of the Ashwood factory and fleet assets is imperative. The factory’s loss would undermine PALA’s strategic foothold, while BDF’s substantial bomber fleet poses a persistent missile threat capable of penetrating defenses against high-value targets.\r\n\r\nThis semi-linear, semi-free mission is designed for single-player gameplay, featuring extensive NPC air support to assist players. Multiplayer participants may adjust AI parameters and rewards pre-match.\r\n\r\nGiven the scale of carrier group engagements and dense air defense networks, performance may dip during large-scale AA battles—recommend switching to free camera view and watching fireworks during these stages. A future iteration will address lag by removing radar-guided and long-range anti-surface missiles.\r\n\r\nExpected duration exceeds two hours, varying with player engagement.\r\n\r\nCredit to Chakal16’s OP Rising Tsunami Extended mod, which provided the foundation for this mod’s development via its exemplary use of the mission editor.",

As such, only your skill matters in this version of Confrontation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, overpowered aircraft/weapons have been nerfed/banned, ensuring a fairer fight for all players, regardless of rank.\r\n\r\nNote: Some aircraft may have some loadout options removed unintentionally. Currently banning items, bans them from all aircraft.\r\nUnfortunately, there is nothing I can do about this unless the developers add the ability to limit weapons on a per-aircraft basis.",

To play singleplayer, please increase the AI count to at least 5.[/i]\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Pacific Island, a generic island in the Pacific Ocean during the Second Great War. You are tasked with either defending the small naval airbase on Vigil Cay, or participating in the attack against it. Two Boscalian carriers have assumed a rough combat formation alongside multiple destroyers and smaller vessels, with a near impenetrable defense layer. Vigil Cay lacks proper defense, but has large numbers of long-range flak cannons, medium-range autocannon turrets, and light machine guns which can help to deter any attackers.\r\n\r\nBoscali has access to a faraway heavy bomber airfield where Darkreaches can be launched.\r\n\r\nBoth factions will recieve a 'second chance' and counteroffensive assault spawn once their defenses have been destroyed.\r\n\r\nBoth factions recieve 3 nukes every 15-20 minutes, and Darkreach airframes every few minutes.",

    "description": "\"Advanced airframes don't matter when they're outnumbred ten to one!\" A BDF pilot shortly before sortieing on a zerg rush.\r\n\r\nJoin Boscali on their counter offensive to cripple Primeva before they can bear down with their expensive fighters, heavy bombers and tough Linebreakers. Using extra airframes, especially the crickets, is of little issue, as long as the enemy buckles before we do. We have the numbers, they don't.\r\n\r\nTips:\r\n- Plentiful aircraft doesn't mean infinite. Take care of your buddies and make those airframes count.\r\n- Join the zerg rush. Do it. Well, you can also hit unprotected objectives too.\r\n- Taking out enemy aircraft can give you some breathing room. Take advantage of their longer respawn times.\r\n- Try to bring IR missiles for cruise missile spam. It'll take the load off of your air defenses. Have a plan for the increased convoy defenses too.\r\n- If you can kill the destroyers fast (or keep their AShM's depleted without losing) you can almost bide your time. Fast work will further hurt their numbers though.\r\n\r\nIts what should've been a 5 second edit of Pest Control PvP, which you can find here:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3192785718\r\n\r\nAlternate versions here:\r\nBDF: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3213702762\r\nPALA: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3213720655\r\n\r\nAll of which are in my collection here:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3192743622\r\n\r\nUpdated for 0.30.9.",

    "description": "A singleplayer / co-op score-attack-style mission for 1 - 5 players. Primarily focused on ground attack. The mission will end after a set time of one hour, during which time the player(s) must strike at least one base in each of five areas scattered across the Primevan heartland to unlock the victory condition. Starting airbases are randomly assigned at mission start.\r\n\r\nCash is extremely limited; plentiful reserve aircraft will be provided, but advanced munitions will be very difficult to afford. Once the victory condition has been secured, try to aim for the highest end score by destroying as many non-critical targets as possible. \"End score\" is based on Primeva's score minus Boscali's score. Post your results in the Discord or in the comments below, as well as player count etc., I'm curious to see how thoroughly this mission can be beaten with a team of human players.",

    "description": "One week after the attack on Harmony Sands Airbase, our intelligence network discovered that there's tensions within the Primevan government. An extremist group called the People's Armed Liberation Alliance (PALA) were the ones behind the attack. Intel reports and satellite imagery confirmed that they're operating at the abandoned Broken Atol Airfield. Primeva and Fleet Task Force Avenger will conduct this joint operation.\r\n\r\nThe Primevan Government and it's citizens has let us utilize their International Airport as a FOB for refueling and rearming. Fly high to conserve fuel when necessary. Our mission is to clear out any air resistance and air defense networks for our Fleet Task Force Avenger, which will launch a barage of cruise missiles to help soften up targets for the Primevan bombers to destroy this base permanently....\r\n\r\n***This is a story based mission, with a sprinkle of NATO brevity codes to give it a sense of \"realism.\" This mission is short and sweet. Aiming for those who like having a linear story, and those who want to learn NATO brevity if they decide to get into DCS.***\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is Part 4 from the aerial campaign.\r\n\r\nMission Order\r\n1) Training Day\r\n2) Payback\r\n3) Retaliation\r\n4) Eye for an Eye\r\n5) Operation Nightfall (Coming Soon)\r\n\r\n\r\n(I appreciate any feedback)",

    "description": "You're a rookie fresh out of Boscali Military Academy. You've been sent to Bifurca Airbase tasked with learning the basics of flying and utilizing brevity codes when deploying ordinance.\r\n\r\nBoscali and Primeva had growing tensions about trade and border disputes over the years. While Boscali claims that the Primevan people have always been part of the Boscali nation. The Primevan people and its government say that Boscali should respect its sovereignty. Both nations ratified a non aggression treaty, the first step to creating a unified nation full of peace, prosperity, and security. Although some Primevan people believe their government is too soft and called them traitors; this new emerging shadow decides to put matters into their own hands....\r\n\r\n\r\n***This is a story based mission, with a sprinkle of NATO brevity codes to give it a sense of \"realism.\" This mission is short and sweet. Aiming for those who like having a linear story, and those who want to learn NATO brevity if they decide to get into DCS.***\r\n\r\nThis is Mission 1 of an ongoing series (I'll post the order of the series as I develop more missions).\r\n\r\n(This is my first attempt in making a full mission after messing with the editor and I'm currently learning how everything works as I go).",

We are coming back to keep them from being overwhelmed. \r\nAs it stand our current objective is to provide assistance. We'll be relocating to Burlington AFB while we properly gauge the size of this civil war and determine what level of involvement we are actually going to provide. \r\nUntil we get to the mainland, we'll be updating our Combat Air Patrols, so you'll be going up fully armed every flight from now on. \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth level made for a short story giving context to the escalating conflict being fought in the skies of Boscalia.\r\n\r\nThis mission is expected to take 1 hr - 1 hr 30 min. to complete.\r\nMedium - High Complexity.\r\nBuilt with optional co-op in mind (1-3 players).\r\n\r\nIf you have feedback or questions about the level creator, leave a comment or message me on Reddit.\r\nu/Blargame",

There are only a few IR SAMS so you won't be beeping every 2 seconds, but stay alert as they are tucked away in newly built areas. There are no enemy fighters, only dozens of logistic aircraft flying around the area to build up their new navy. The Navy has not done sea trials, so all ships are currently unprepared for combat as they take on supplies in ports around the island. \n\u000bEngage at will, have fun!",

    "description": "Race course over the highways connecting the  Dustbowl and Sandrift bases. I tried to set the waypoints and obstacles in such a way that allows for at least 6 players to navigate the course at the same time. My solo runs are between 24 and 28 minutes, depending on airframe.\r\n- 62 waypoints per lap, 4 laps per race. \r\n- 6 hangars, 3 per faction\r\n\r\nI made this track to satisfy the Dirt Rally / Gran Turismo fan in me. As in those games, this course requires players to be at the right speed at the right time to navigate its corners. You'll also need to manage fuel consumption and pilot stamina. \r\n\r\nYou don't get any money and there isn't a massive inventory of reserve airframes, so it would behoove you to take care of your aircraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** THE FOLLOWING TIMES ARE OUTDATED***\r\n- The new flight / physics model drastically changes how pilots navigate the course. I'll remove the old times once I have a full set of new ones. -\r\nThe following are my personal bests for each fighter (as of 31 July 2025). Each was with aggressive flying and a pit stop after lap 2.\r\nCompass: 26:22 (w/ 50% fuel load)\r\nRevoker:   24:13 \r\nVortex:      26:34\r\nIfrit:           24:42\r\n\r\n",

There is a corvette on the Northeast corner.\r\n\r\nThere is a helipad in Maris City, and medium hangars added to Sandrift. There is also a stationary carrier at Vigil Cay.\r\n\r\nAirbases should be capturable, deliberately so to allow teaching of this mechanic.\r\n\r\nNote: Vigil Cay is heavily defended. I did this to ensure the 'instructor' doesn't get spawncamped. As such, there are relatively few targets the closer you get to the island.",

Its nose to exhaust and people are flying recklessly while blasting music. Hearing \"Free Bird\" blaring in the distance and rapidly approaching doesn't give a good feeling.\r\n\r\nPackage pirates from all around have taken a *very special* interest in you and particularly the packages onboard your craft, since you're a newer employee. Of course you're not gonna let them get ahold of company property. Instead, once you arrive you'll recieve the packages and their delivery addresses. All you gotta do is, uhh, deliver them and that'll be it for the work day.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely more light hearted and trashpost esque than most missions, as well as not too long to play (hopefully). We need more of them TBH. Of course I'm making it as tough as I can manage to complete.\r\n\r\nTips:\r\n- As the host, DON'T LEAVE your AIRCRAFT for any reason, or you'll FAIL the MISSION.\r\n- Your AI allies will also follow you. (the host)\r\n- Ground AD should be toned down. This can be a double edged sword as both your bases and theirs will be easier to attack, so make sure they're protected.\r\n- Nukes should be available from the start. Beware of other players using nukes as they have a good chance of sneaking them in.\r\n\r\nUpdated to 0.29. Viva la Thumbnail de Cringe",

Unfortunately, many of our airframes were damaged in the Primevan attack, so only our supply of counter-insurgency craft remained intact. Good luck pilot.\r\n\r\nAuthor's Note: Hey y'all! It's me again back with another operation but this one ISN'T a meme. Imagine that! Anyways, this was mainly an experiment to play around with multi-phase operations and enemy spawning, but I gave it a level of polish through playtesting after the rough outline was built. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it! And as always, best of luck pilot!",

    "description": "Pilots, we don't have much time but I must brief you on the situation at hand. Early this morning at 0200hrs large amounts of enemy troop movement began to occur in the Eastern Border Regions suggesting an invasion force making its way to our territory. Not 15 minutes ago at 0530hrs the enemy forces mobilised and intelligence suggests at least two enemy airfields have been made combat ready for aircraft deployment and enemy Naval Forces are securing the Central Sea. It seems an invasion is inevitable. \r\nOur mission is to eliminate as many ground forces and air forces as possible while ultimately destroying the active airbases. It is the hope of the General Staff that, if we complete these objectives with haste, neither the enemy, nor we,  will resort to the Nuclear Option in defence of utter defeat. But remember that it is now no longer outside the realm of possibility. To your craft, and good luck!\r\n\r\n(A combined-arms battle on the eastern half of the map, limited to smaller aircraft. Each side has one main airbase and one forward airbase, with naval assets watching the flanks.)",

    "description": "War? No. This is merely a peacekeeping initiative.\r\n- General Staff\r\n\r\nPilots, the word made it out to the public quicker than it made it to us, but those damn guards down there on the Eastern Borders started firing pot shots at each other and now there's just about a full on skirmish for the Central Oil Refinery. The General Staff on both sides have been reluctant to call for any cease fire due to the potential to lay a stronger claim on the Refinery itself. The internal ministry has assigned you to leading an offensive against the enemy forward base and capturing or destroying it to push the opposing Generals to  call for a true cease fire and resolution to this mess. Further, although we've trained you for the Nuclear Option there will be certainly no need nor desire to use such insane means for such a small objective. Thus, all tactical and strategic nuclear platforms are strictly prohibited for use and will not be available for outfit. Don't take too long, the public won't look on any of this fondly. Good luck!\r\n\r\n(Low intensity non-nuclear fighting over the disputed zone. Each side operates from a single forward airbase and must destroy the other's. Aircraft are restricted to counter-insurgency platforms, trainers, and gunships, with no medium or long range air-to-air missiles available. Air battles are resolved either with guns, or the relatively short ranged IRM-S1.)",

    "description": "Pilots, we don't have much time but I must brief you on the situation at hand. Early this morning at 0200hrs large amounts of enemy troop movement began to occur in the Eastern Border Regions suggesting an invasion force making its way to our territory. Not 15 minutes ago at 0530hrs the enemy forces mobilised and intelligence suggests at least two enemy airfields have been made combat ready for aircraft deployment and enemy Naval Forces are securing the Central Sea. It seems an invasion is inevitable. \r\nOur mission is to elimnate as many ground forces and air forces as possible while ultimately destroying the active airbases. It is the opinion of the General Staff that the enemy does not seek to deploy Nuclear Weapons in search of their goals and more likely wish to occupy the Eastern Regions and attempt to declare their entrance into their domain. To this end you have been prohibited against the deployment of the Nuclear Option against the enemy and will instead focus on securing the invaders bases for our own conglomeration. To your craft, and good luck!\r\n\r\n(A combined-arms battle on the eastern half of the map, limited to smaller aircraft. Each side has one main airbase and one forward airbase, with naval assets watching the flanks.)",

We must act fast and act first, securing air superiority in a surprise struggle the enemy war-planners will not have anticipated. We don't know how committed they are to this move, but if it goes south for them real quick they may just throw up the Nuclear Option as a last hurrah against our air domination.

Intelligence, with plans of our own, have lead the General Staff to order the full-scale mobilisation of our Armed Forces against the enemy. It is in a bid, from both sides, to destroy each others military assets in the region and secure it holy for one faction. As you may have been thinking, the Nuclear Option is not off the table to achieve this objective. I'm sorry that this will be the culmination of your training, but you must do your very best to eliminate their air bases and factories with haste, before Nuclear Weapons are considered. A full escalation may mean the complete destruction of all cities and arable lands in the region, leaving the victorious faction with a poisoned land and many more dying and starving people. Try not to let it weigh to hard on your conscience, remember your training. Good luck, to your craft, Defend our Home!\r\n\r\n(An enormous, high intensity war of attrition with all airbases active and using all available assets.\r\nSuccessively more powerful aircraft, and eventually thermonuclear weapons, are unlocked by increasing individual and team point score respectively.)",

The weather has veiled much of the Western Boscali Coast, and the Southern Straights from good radar penetration and thus defending this critical base will be vastly more difficult than the surprise attack wrought upon it yesterday. Furthermore, there is good reason to believe the deployment of Tactical Nuclear Weapons may be inevitable. Deployment of Strategic Nuclear Weapons by the BDF may occur should the attrition to their forces prove too great to overcome the defences. Can they prove them further that even those Arrows of Death can not penetrate PALA resilience? Good luck, and defend Vigil Cay!\r\n\r\n(Challenging co-op mission where PALA defends the Island airbase from a naval attack.)",

    "description": "Backstory: \"We didn't expect them to be up and running so quickly after we nuked each other to the ground, but somehow they had enough forces to take the Naval Airbase, and got City up and running too. This is our last chance, we need to make a counter attack before they shut us down for good. We've managed to get a hold of some advanced export fighters in the last \"skirmish\" and you'll be using them in the assault. Make them count, we only have a few.\r\n\r\n\"Phase 1: South Boscali Airbase seems to be the most lightly defended airbase in our reach. The enemy's air defense network shouldn't be underestimated though, so your best bet is to sneak in from the north under their radar and strike. Once you've finished them off, or if our cover is blown, we'll launch our attack immediately.\r\n\r\n\"Phase 2: We've amassed all the troops, supplies, and equipment we could at SBA, and so they need to be protected at all costs. The mission, and the war, is practically over the moment we lose our supply line. Of course, protect and support any deployed assets where possible. There's several area's of attack planned:\r\n\r\n\"Naval Airbase: By the time the attack launches we should have troops landing at the Naval Airbase. Once you assault the base you'll need to keep them safe as they capture the airbase and clean up any leftover resistance.\r\n\r\n\"City Airbase: We've built a depot as close to the enemy as possible but we'll need to cut deep into their lines to disable their airbase. For that, I recommend clearing out their highway bases so we can capture and reuse them. The Airbase itself is where the majority of their supplies are, so its of course a priority target.\r\n\r\n\"Phase 3: North Boscali Airbase isn't operational yet but could pose a big risk. They're building a fortified factory thats not only heavily armored and defended but can rapidly produce vehicles. Intel also suggests they had more carriers in storage and are getting ready to deploy them. Be ready to take them all down once they're up. Hopefully we'll be finished with the other bases by then.\r\n\r\nWe're also racing to get our own main airbases operational as well. As we capture and repair bases we can use them to deploy heavier airframes, as long as they don't get nuked out of existence again.\"\r\n\r\nTips:\r\n- Be careful when deploying nukes around the eastern airbases, to avoid destroying our reinforcements as they attempt to capture the bases.\r\n- Don't overfocus on any one area of the map, but attack and support different areas as needed. Trust your team to clean up.\r\n- Even with the economy/ limited inventory, sacrificing your airframe can pay off.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like an amalgamation of arcade flight/ war game tropes (just gotta shove super duper wonder weapons in), I agree lol, but that wasn't the first or only inspiration for this mission. Part of the mission design came from FreeDoom, of all things.\r\n\r\nOther features not mentioned:\r\n- You get two chances at the stealth part at mission start, after which your buddies will *try* to capture the base (they're almost certain to get wiped out or take enough losses to cost you the mission later, so this part matters). If you do it in one take, you can use the airframes later in the mission.\r\n- The other airbases and reinforcements spawn in on a timer or on a trigger. If you're too slow or aren't prepared you'll risk getting overwhelmed, so work fast and plan ahead. At the same time, its not a complete loss if you dont beat the timers. You have time, so use it.\r\n- If at any point SBA gets wiped out, the mission skips to phase 3 and all factories, depots, and carriers get spawned in. This is sort of a \"last chance\" but also will allow Boscali to win, quite easily if you didn't work on the objectives enough.\r\n\r\nMap is by TunderTunder. Crude but hopefully informational cuttlefish drawing is mine. Updated for 0.30.9.",

Over 800 beautiful road nodes have been placed, and I have connected it to the highways leading to the pre-placed map roads. The AI is still not the brightest, and can get stuck in certain parts, but it works decently well.  feel free to use this however you want. if you publish a map/mission that uses this template, just remember to give credit.",

    "description": "I HIGHLY recommend checking out my newest mission, it is much better than this one. This mission was a test bed for a large scale invasion battle and will likely not be updated further.\r\n\r\nIt's the year 207#... All hell has broken loose, the first Boscalian civil war has begun. The Liberation army has taken control of 5 Major airbase locations, and are pushing us further back. According to our intel, they have deployed their captured naval vessels to intercept our carrier strike groups, and are currently mobilizing their army forces towards grid G-9 and H-8 (Our major city, as well as Highway K-92 and Maris Airbase.) Some stray forces were detected heading for the general aviation sector, but we should be able to hold off that front pretty easily. Along with the captured airbases, they captured our secondary aircraft reserves and now have access to the production guides and a large amount of every type of aircraft. As unfortunate as it is, it also seems they have captured some nuclear warhead reserves as well, we may need to take the NUCLEAR OPTION.\r\n\r\nAn unrealistically large conflict for these factions... This is for players that like to have more action per game. Good luck, because whoever wins, gets full control of The Boscali Islands.\r\n",

    "description": "\"They're on our left, they're on our right, they're in front of us, they're behind us ... They can't get away this time.\" Some Primevan CO, maybe. \"They've got us surrounded again, the poor bastards.\" was just too obvious.\r\n\r\nJoin Primeva in beating back Boscali's offensive of low tier planes and AFV8's, and exterminate the source of their supplies before they infest your bases and swarm you out for good! (and bring your FPS to its knees too). Capture their forward bases along the way and stay alive or at least take many more of them down than they do you and your mates. you'll need to retain all the numbers you can.\r\n\r\nTips:\r\n- Be careful with sacrificing your airframe, make sure it pays off. DO NOT dump and eject, especially with the new economy update. If possible, try to not die lol.\r\n- Take care of your teammates too so you can keep your numbers high, and use them for support. Don't be more outnumbered in a fight or push than you have to be.\r\n- Taking out individual units will only buy you a little time and space. Go for airbases or objectives that are under attack or aren't heavily guarded. Keep in mind AI confidence increases with numbers.\r\n- Work fast. The longer you take, the more aircraft and vehicles they spawn.\r\n- Try to bring AA missiles, especially IR, for aircraft or cruise missile spam. It'll take the load off of your air defenses.\r\n\r\nIts what should've been a 5 second edit of Pest Control PvP, which you can find here:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3192785718\r\n\r\nAlternate versions here:\r\nBDF: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3213702762\r\nPALA: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3213720655\r\n\r\nAll of which are in my collection here:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3192743622\r\n\r\nUpdated for 0.30.9.",

Just minutes later, one of our AWACS Medusas detected a large formation of enemy aircraft inbound on our city, with what we suspect is a nuclear payload. The MDG won't be back online in time to stop them. You need to get up there and buy us some time. Assets have been deployed from the city to try and help but they'll easily be overwhelmed unless we have a miracle.\u000b\u000bSo make that miracle happen.\n\n((This is a wave based defense mission. 20 Enemy aircraft will approach in waves of 6, 8, and 8 respectively. You begin in a Revoker with 4 Compasses and 1 Medusa to back you up, and 3 more revokers on the way.))\u000b\u000b((The road just north of the city has had an impromptu re-arming point set up, if you can find the chance to use it amid the waves of enemies.))\u000b\u000b((My first scripted mission Pls provide comments and feedback.))",

    "description": "Ever thought your flight sim game needed minigames in it? Probably not but here it is anyway.\r\n\r\nWarWare is based on the Base War Map (The old, pre workshop one with new changes manually added) but now with 'minigames' that potentially can give your team an edge in the fight for Boscali/ Primeva, or ruin everything if not completed properly or ignored. Heavily inspired off the WarioWare series, as well as some advice from Squeegy that I used thoroughly out of context.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- 9 mini optional objectives to complete (dual airbase duels, SEAD 'n DEAD, truck hide 'n seek, Geneva suggestion, lag swarm, nuclear blitz, booming business, drag race, and break time). some give some sort bonus on completion. The rest spawn in some sort of unit or building atm, which you should protect and destroy like usual.\r\n- AI will actually participate as best as they can. They're of course not too good at it, especially the geneva suggestions game as they have no trigger discipline and may need to be actively prevented from failing the minigame. They also can't complete the race minigme, even though they'll try.\r\n- In-game messages to hint at what to do. Mostly memes and references to make you annoyed at me rather than legitimately help lol.\r\n- Low cloud cover to really spice things up.\r\n\r\nI'm open to adding more minigames too as long as I can do it through the current mission editor. There'll probably be more added as I come up with more silly ideas, just keep in mind the mission editor is meant for military style missions and not silly microgames.\r\n\r\nUpdated for 0.30.9. Logo is from Nintendo/ Intelligent Systems. Emote is from the discord... still dunno who made it lmao.",

Go play escalation or one of the user made maps (including mine here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3192743622 ) that's better than this.\r\n\r\nThis is a scratch made version of Escalation. (Yep, its not an edit, even if it would've been better) The main difference is air defenses/ radar points are less dense, factories and vehicle depots are co-located with airfields as best as possible (Except Naval Airbase because ground units will literally drive into the ocean to get there) and everything should be slightly more balanced. Oh and the mission sort of escalates as things happen. Intended for single player, smaller multiplayer matches, or as a template for missions where editing the Escalation map doesn't cut it, or so I tell myself.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason you want to use this as a template, navigate to\r\n[Your Steam Folder Location]\\steamapps\\workshop\\content\\2168680\\3192737833\\PJ's Base War Map.json\r\nor in-game> Workshop> open local file (whichever mission you want to dupe)> and pluck the file.\r\nMove it to\r\nC:\\Users\\[Your User Folder]\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Shockfront\\NuclearOption\\Missions\r\nor wherever your mission folder is, and let the game put it in a folder for you\r\n\r\nThis map is updated for 0.30.9.",

    "description": "    This is a rather wild game of escalation that takes place along the north eastern side of the map. The staple of this mission is the inclusion of two large custom airbases situated on the side of two different mountains. While, given the restrictions of Nuclear Option, you are unable to respawn at these, feel free to use them to rearm. These are heavily defended and difficult to crack. \r\n\r\n    This mission can be played single or multiplayer. Some objectives may ask the player, or give a recommendation towards a new objective. For example, blowing up the munition trucks after taking the first airfield is recommended as your friendly aircraft will try to spawn otherwise. This mission can support up to a 4v4 battle. \r\n\r\nHave fun and enjoy.",
